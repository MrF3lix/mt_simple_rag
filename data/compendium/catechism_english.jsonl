{"num":9,"text":"9\n\"The\nministry of catechesis draws ever fresh energy from the councils. the Council\nof Trent is a noteworthy example of this.

{"num":10,"text":"10\nIt is\ntherefore no surprise that catechesis in the Church has again attracted\nattention in the wake of the Second Vatican Council, which Pope Paul Vl\nconsidered the great catechism of modern times. the General Catechetical\nDirectory (1971) the sessions of the Synod of Bishops devoted to evangelization\n(1974) and catechesis (1977), the apostolic exhortations Evangelii nuntiandi\n(1975) and Catechesi tradendae (1979), attest to this. the Extraordinary Synod\nof Bishops in 1985 asked \"that a catechism or compendium of all Catholic\ndoctrine regarding both faith and morals be composed\"13 The Holy\nFather, Pope John Paul II, made the Synod's wish his own, acknowledging that\n\"this desire wholly corresponds to a real need of the universal Church and\nof the particular Churches.\"14 He set in motion everything needed\nto carry out the Synod Fathers' wish."}

Before expounding the Church's faith, as confessed in the Creed,\ncelebrated in the liturgy and lived in observance of God's commandments and in\nprayer, we must first ask what \"to believe\" means. Faith is man's\nresponse to God, who reveals himself and gives himself to man, at the same time\nbringing man a superabundant light as he searches for the ultimate meaning of\nhis life. Thus we shall consider first that search (Chapter One), then the\ndivine Revelation by which God comes to meet man (Chapter Two), and finally the\nresponse of faith (Chapter Three)."}

Far from showing us a community seized by a mystical exaltation,\nthe Gospels present us with disciples demoralized (\"looking\nsad\"503) and frightened. For they had not believed the holy women\nreturning from the tomb and had regarded their words as an \"idle\ntale\".504 When Jesus reveals himself to the Eleven on Easter\nevening, \"he upbraided them for their unbelief and hardness of heart,\nbecause they had not believed those who saw him after he had\nrisen.\"505"}

We seek him, because to desire him is always the\nbeginning of love, and we seek him in that pure faith which causes us to be\nborn of him and to live in him. In this inner prayer we can still meditate, but\nour attention is fixed on the Lord himself."}
{"num":2710,"text":"2710\nThe choice of the time and duration of the prayer arises from a determined\nwill, revealing the secrets of the heart.

One cannot always meditate, but one can always enter into inner\nprayer, independently of the conditions of health, work, or emotional state. the\nheart is the place of this quest and encounter, in poverty ant in faith."}
{"num":2711,"text":"2711\nEntering into contemplative prayer is like entering into the Eucharistic\nliturgy: we \"gather up:\" the heart, recollect our whole being under the\nprompting of the Holy Spirit, abide in the dwelling place of the Lord which we\nare, awaken our faith in order to enter into the presence of him who awaits us.\nWe let our masks fall and turn our hearts back to the Lord who loves us, so as\nto hand ourselves over to him as an offering to be purified and transformed."}

His gaze purifies our heart; the light of the countenance\nof Jesus illumines the eyes of our heart and teaches us to see everything in\nthe light of his truth and his compassion for all men.

{"num":2724,"text":"2724 Contemplative prayer is\nthe simple expression of the mystery of prayer. It is a gaze of faith fixed on\nJesus, an attentiveness to the Word of God, a silent love. It achieves real\nunion with the prayer of Christ to the extent that it makes us share in his\nmystery."}
{"num":2725,"text":"2725\nPrayer is both a gift of grace and a determined response on our part. It always\npresupposes effort. the great figures of prayer of the Old Covenant before\nChrist, as well as the Mother of God, the saints, and he himself, all teach us\nthis: prayer is a battle. Against whom? Against ourselves and against the wiles\nof the tempter who does all he can to turn man away from prayer, away from\nunion with God. We pray as we live, because we live as we pray. If we do not\nwant to act habitually according to the Spirit of Christ, neither can we pray\nhabitually in his name. the \"spiritual battle\" of the Christian's new\nlife is inseparable from the battle of prayer."}
{"num":2726,"text":"2726\nIn the battle of prayer, we must face in ourselves and around us erroneous\nnotions of prayer. Some people view prayer as a simple psychological activity,\nothers as an effort of concentration to reach a mental void. Still others\nreduce prayer to ritual words and postures. Many Christians unconsciously\nregard prayer as an occupation that is incompatible with all the other things\nthey have to do: they \"don't have the time.\" Those who seek God by\nprayer are quickly discouraged because they do not know that prayer comes also\nfrom the Holy Spirit and not from themselves alone."}
{"num":2727,"text":"2727\nWe must also face the fact that certain attitudes deriving from the mentality\nof \"this present world\" can penetrate our lives if we are not\nvigilant. For example, some would have it that only that is true which can be\nverified by reason and science; yet prayer is a mystery that overflows both our\nconscious and unconscious lives. Others overly prize production and profit;\nthus prayer, being unproductive, is useless. Still others exalt sensuality and\ncomfort as the criteria of the true, the good, and the beautiful; whereas\nprayer, the \"love of beauty\" (philokalia), is caught up in the glory\nof the living and true God. Finally, some see prayer as a flight from the world\nin reaction against activism; but in fact, Christian prayer is neither an escape\nfrom reality nor a divorce from life."}
{"num":2728,"text":"2728\nFinally, our battle has to confront what we experience as failure in prayer:\ndiscouragement during periods of dryness; sadness that, because we have\n\"great possessions,\"15 we have not given all to the Lord;\ndisappointment over not being heard according to our own will; wounded pride,\nstiffened by the indignity that is ours as sinners; our resistance to the idea\nthat prayer is a free and unmerited gift; and so forth. the conclusion is\nalways the same: what good does it do to pray?

{"num":2729,"text":"2729\nThe habitual difficulty in prayer is distraction. It can affect words and their\nmeaning in vocal prayer; it can concern, more profoundly, him to whom we are\npraying, in vocal prayer (liturgical or personal), meditation, and\ncontemplative prayer. To set about hunting down distractions would be to fall\ninto their trap, when all that is necessary is to turn back to our heart: for a\ndistraction reveals to us what we are attached to, and this humble awareness\nbefore the Lord should awaken our preferential love for him and lead us resolutely\nto offer him our heart to be purified. Therein lies the battle, the choice of\nwhich master to serve.16"}
{"num":2730,"text":"2730\nIn positive terms, the battle against the possessive and dominating self\nrequires vigilance, sobriety of heart.

{"num":2731,"text":"2731\nAnother difficulty, especially for those who sincerely want to pray, is\ndryness.

{"num":2732,"text":"2732\nThe most common yet most hidden temptation is our lack of faith. It expresses\nitself less by declared incredulity than by our actual preferences.

Sometimes we turn to the Lord as a last resort, but do we really believe\nhe is? Sometimes we enlist the Lord as an ally, but our heart remains\npresumptuous. In each case, our lack of faith reveals that we do not yet share\nin the disposition of a humble heart: \n\"Apart from me, you can do nothing.\"20"}
{"num":2733,"text":"2733\nAnother temptation, to which presumption opens the gate, is acedia. the\nspiritual writers understand by this a form of depression due to lax ascetical\npractice, decreasing vigilance, carelessness of heart. \"The spirit indeed\nis willing, but the flesh is weak.\"21 The greater the height, the\nharder the fall.

There is a\ncertain usefulness to temptation. No one but God knows what our soul has\nreceived from him, not even we ourselves.
