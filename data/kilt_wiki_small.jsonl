DeMille, shot in VistaVision (color by Technicolor), and released by Paramount Pictures. The film is based on \"Prince of Egypt\" by Dorothy Clarke Wilson, \"Pillar of Fire\" by J.H. Ingraham, \"On Eagle's Wings\" by A.E. Southon, and the Book of Exodus. \"The Ten Commandments\" dramatizes the biblical story of the life of Moses, an adopted Egyptian prince who becomes the deliverer of his real brethren, the enslaved Hebrews, and therefore leads the Exodus to Mount Sinai, where he receives, from God, the Ten Commandments. The film stars Charlton Heston in the lead role, Yul Brynner as Rameses, Anne Baxter as Nefretiri, Edward G. Robinson as Dathan, Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora, Debra Paget as Lilia, and John Derek as Joshua; and features Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Sethi, Nina Foch as Bithiah, Martha Scott as Yochabel, Judith Anderson as Memnet, and Vincent Price as Baka, among others.\n","Filmed on location in Egypt, Mount Sinai and the Sinai Peninsula, the film was DeMille's last and most successful work. It is a partial remake of his 1923 silent film of the same title, and features one of the largest sets ever created for a film. The film was released to cinemas in the United States on November 8, 1956 and, at the time of its release, was the most expensive film ever made.\n","In 1957, the film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, including Best Picture, winning the Academy Award for Best Visual Effects (John P. Fulton, A.S.C.). DeMille won the Foreign Language Press Film Critics Circle Award for Best Director. Charlton Heston was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture (Drama) for his role as Moses. Yul Brynner won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor for his role as Rameses and his other roles in \"Anastasia\" and \"The King and I\". It is also one of the most financially successful films ever made, grossing approximately $122.7 million at the box office during its initial release; it was the most successful film of 1956 and the second-highest-grossing film of the decade. According to \"Guinness World Records\", in terms of theatrical exhibition it is the eighth most successful film of all-time when the box office gross is adjusted for inflation.\n","In 1999, the film was selected for preservation in the United States National Film Registry by the Library of Congress as being \"culturally, historically, or aesthetically significant\". In June 2008, the American Film Institute revealed its \"Ten Top Ten\"\u2014the best ten films in ten American film genres\u2014after polling over 1,500 people from the creative community. The film was listed as the tenth best film in the epic genre. Network television has aired the film in prime time during the Passover\/Easter season every year since 1973.\n","Section::::Plot.\n","Pharaoh Rameses I of Egypt orders the death of all newborn Hebrew males. Yochabel saves her infant son by setting him adrift in a basket on the Nile. Bithiah, the Pharaoh's daughter, finds the basket and decides to adopt the boy even though her servant, Memnet, recognizes the child is Hebrew. Bithiah names the baby Moses.\n","Prince Moses grows up to become a successful general, winning a war with Ethiopia and establishing an alliance. Moses and princess Nefretiri fall in love, but she must marry the next Pharaoh. While working on the building of a city for Pharaoh Sethi's jubilee, Moses meets the stonecutter Joshua, who tells him of the Hebrew God. Moses saves an elderly woman from being crushed not knowing that she is his biological mother, Yochabel, and he reprimands the taskmaster and overseer Baka.\n","Moses reforms the treatment of slaves on the project, but Prince Rameses, Moses's adoptive brother, charges him with planning an insurrection. Moses says he is making his workers more productive, making Rameses wonder if Moses is the man the Hebrews are calling the Deliverer.\n","Nefretiri learns from Memnet that Moses is the son of Hebrew slaves. She kills Memnet but reveals the story to Moses only after he finds the piece of Levite cloth he was wrapped in as a baby, which Memnet had kept. Moses follows Bithiah to Yochabel's house where he meets his biological mother, Brother Aaron, and Sister Miriam.\n","Moses learns more about the slaves by working with them. Nefretiri urges him to return to the palace so he may help his people when he becomes pharaoh, to which he agrees after he completes a final task. Moses saves Joshua from death by killing Baka, telling Joshua that he too is Hebrew. The confession is witnessed by the overseer Dathan, who then reports to Rameses. After being arrested, Moses explains that he is not the Deliverer, but would free the slaves if he could. Sethi banishes Moses to the desert leaving Rameses as the sole heir. Yochabel dies sometime later.\n","Moses makes his way across the desert to a well in Midian. After defending seven sisters from Amalekites, Moses is housed with the girls' father Jethro, a Bedouin sheik, who worships the God of Abraham. Moses marries Jethro's eldest daughter Sephora. Later, he finds Joshua, who has escaped hard labor. While farming, Moses sees the burning bush on the summit of Mount Sinai and hears the voice of God. Moses returns to Egypt to free the Hebrews.\n","Moses comes before Rameses, now pharaoh, to win the slaves' freedom, turning his staff into a cobra. Jannes performs the same trick with his staves, but Moses's snake swallows his. Rameses prohibits straw from being provided to the Hebrews to make their bricks. Nefretiri rescues Moses from being stoned to death by the Hebrews wherein he reveals that he is married.\n","Egypt is visited by plagues. Moses turns the river Nile to blood at a festival of Khnum and brings burning hail down upon Pharaoh's palace. Moses warns him the next plague to fall upon Egypt will be summoned by Pharaoh himself. Enraged at the plagues, Rameses orders all first-born Hebrews to die, but a cloud of death instead kills all the firstborn of Egypt, including the child of Rameses and Nefretiri. Angrily, Pharaoh exiles the Hebrews, which begins the Exodus from Egypt.\n","Rameses takes his army and pursues the Hebrews to the Red Sea. Moses uses God's help to stop the Egyptians with a pillar of fire and parts the Red Sea. After the Hebrews make it to safety, Moses releases the walls of water, drowning the Egyptian army. A devastated Rameses returns empty-handed to Nefretiri, stating that he now acknowledges Moses's god as God.\n","Moses again ascends the mountain with Joshua. He sees the Ten Commandments created by God in two stone tablets. Meanwhile, an impatient Dathan urges a reluctant Aaron to construct a golden calf idol as a gift for Rameses. A wild and decadent orgy is held by most of the Hebrews.\n","After God informs Moses of the orgy, the latter descends from the mountain and reunites with Joshua. Enraged at the sight of decadence, he throws the tablets at the golden calf, which explodes, killing the wicked revelers, and causing the others to wander in the wilderness for 40 years.\n","Forty years later, an elderly Moses leads the Hebrews towards Canaan. However, he could not enter the Promised land due to a mentioned previous disobedience to the Lord. He instead names Joshua as leader, and bids farewell to the Hebrews at Mount Nebo.\n","Section::::Cast.\n","In the film's title sequence, the cast is credited in the following order:\n","BULLET::::- Charlton Heston as Moses (and the voice of God at the Burning Bush)\n","BULLET::::- Yul Brynner as Rameses II\n","BULLET::::- Anne Baxter as Nefretiri\n","BULLET::::- Edward G.

Lasky Jr., Jack Gariss, and Fredric M. Frank. It also contained material from the books \"Prince of Egypt\" by Dorothy Clarke Wilson, \"Pillar of Fire\" by Joseph Holt Ingraham, and \"On Eagle's Wings\" by Arthur Eustace Southon. Henry Noerdlinger, the film's researcher, consulted ancient historical texts such as the Midrash Rabbah, Philo's \"Life of Moses\", and the writings of Josephus and Eusebius in order to \"fill in\" the missing years of Moses' life, and as the film's last opening title card states, \"the Holy Scriptures.\"\n","Section::::Production.:Casting.\n","Charlton Heston, who had previously worked with DeMille in \"The Greatest Show on Earth\", won the part of Moses after he impressed DeMille (at his audition) with his knowledge of ancient Egypt. William Boyd, DeMille's first choice to be auditioned to be Moses in the film, refused the part. Heston was also chosen to be the voice of God in the form of a burning bush, toned down to a softer and lower register.\n","Heston's newborn son, Fraser (born February 12, 1955), was cast by DeMille (on the suggestion of Henry Wilcoxon, who said to him \"The timing's just right. If it's a boy, who better to play the Baby Moses?\") as soon as Heston announced to DeMille that his wife Lydia was pregnant. Fraser Heston was three months old during filming.\n","The part of Nefretiri, the Egyptian throne princess, was considered \"the most sought after role of the year\" in 1954. Ann Blyth, Vanessa Brown, Joan Evans, Rhonda Fleming, Coleen Gray, Jane Griffiths, Audrey Hepburn, Jean Marie, Vivien Leigh, Jane Russell, and Joan Taylor were considered for the part. DeMille liked Audrey Hepburn but dismissed her because of her figure, which was considered too slim for the character's Egyptian gowns. Anne Baxter (who was considered for the part of Moses' wife) was cast in the role.\n","Judith Ames, Anne Bancroft, Anne Baxter, Shirley Booth, Diane Brewster, Peggie Castle, June Clayworth, Linda Darnell, Laura Elliot, Rhonda Fleming, Rita Gam, Grace Kelly, Jacqueline Green, Barbara Hale, Allison Hayes, Frances Lansing, Patricia Neal, Marie Palmer, Jean Peters, Ruth Roman, Barbara Rush, and Elizabeth Sellers were considered for the part of Sephora. Grace Kelly, DeMille's first choice, was unavailable. DeMille was \"very much impressed\" with Yvonne De Carlo's performance as a \"saintly type of woman\" in MGM's \"Sombrero\". He \"sensed in her a depth, an emotional power, a womanly strength which the part of Sephora needed and which she gave it.\" Sephora is the Douay\u2013Rheims version of the name of Zipporah.\n","Merle Oberon and Claudette Colbert were considered for the role of Bithiah before DeMille chose Jayne Meadows (who declined) and finally cast Nina Foch, on the suggestion of Henry Wilcoxon, who had worked with her in \"Scaramouche\".\n","For the role of Memnet, Flora Robson was considered and Bette Davis was interviewed (DeMille's casting journal also notes Marjorie Rambeau and Marie Windsor) but DeMille chose Judith Anderson after screening Alfred Hitchcock's \"Rebecca\".\n","Henry Wilcoxon's wife Joan Woodbury was cast as Korah's wife in the Golden Calf sequence.\n","DeMille was reluctant to cast anyone who had appeared in 20th Century Fox's \"The Egyptian\", a rival production at the time. Several exceptions to this are the casting of John Carradine and Mimi Gibson (in credited supporting roles) and Michael Ansara and Peter Coe (in uncredited minor roles), who appeared in both films.\n","For the Large Crowd shots, at least 14,000 extras and 15,000 animals were used while filming \"The Ten Commandments\".\n","Section::::Production.:Art direction.\n","Commentary for the film's DVD edition chronicles the historical research done by DeMille and associates. Katherine Orrison says that many details of Moses' life left out of the Bible are present in the Quran, which was sometimes used as a source. She also presents some coincidences in production. The man who designed Moses' distinctive rust-white-and-black-striped robe used those colors because they looked impressive, and only later discovered that these are the actual colors of the Tribe of Levi. Arnold Friberg would later state that he was the one who designed Moses' costume. As a gift, after the production, DeMille gave Moses' robe to Friberg, who had it in his possession until his death in 2010. Moses' robe as worn by Charlton Heston was hand-woven by Dorothea Hulse, one of the world's finest weavers. She also created costumes for \"The Robe\", as well as textiles and costume fabrics for \"Samson and Delilah\", \"David and Bathsheba\", and others.\n","Jesse Lasky Jr., a co-writer on \"The Ten Commandments\", described how DeMille would customarily spread out prints of paintings by Lawrence Alma-Tadema to inform his set designers on the look he wanted to achieve. Arnold Friberg, in addition to designing sets and costumes, also contributed the manner in which Moses ordained Joshua to his mission at the end of the film: by the laying on of hands, placing his hands on Joshua's head. Friberg, a member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, demonstrated the LDS manner of performing such ordinations, and DeMille liked it.\n","Pharaoh is usually shown wearing the red-and-white crown of Upper and Lower Egypt or the nemes royal headdress. For his pursuit of the Israelites, he wears the blue Khepresh helmet-crown, which the pharaohs wore for battle.\n","Sets, costumes and props from the film \"The Egyptian\" were bought and re-used for \"The Ten Commandments\" - including the red-and-white double crown. As the events in \"The Egyptian\" take place 70 years before the reign of Rameses II, an unintentional sense of continuity was created.\n","An Egyptian wall painting was also the source for the lively dance performed by a circle of young women at Seti's birthday gala. Their movements and costumes are based on art from the Tomb of the Sixth Dynasty Grand Vizier Mehu.\n","Some of the film's cast members, such as Baxter, Paget, Derek, and Foch, wore brown contact lenses, at the behest of DeMille, in order to conceal their light-colored eyes which were considered inadequate for their roles. Paget once said that, \"If it hadn't been for the lenses I wouldn't have got the part.\" However, she also said that the lenses were \"awful to work in because the kleig lights heat them up\". When DeMille cast Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora, she was worried about having to wear these contact lenses; she also believed that her gray eyes were her best feature. She asked DeMille to make an exception for her. He agreed, expressing the idea that De Carlo's role was special, and that Moses was to fall in love with her.\n","The Exodus set was modeled after the 1923 film. It was built outside Cairo, Egypt. it was designed by Egyptian architect El Dine. inside the set were a Mess Tent, a Wardrobe Department, and a stable for horses (for Egyptian Cavalry sequences).\n","Section::::Production.:Special effects.\n","The special photographic effects in \"The Ten Commandments\" were created by John P. Fulton, A.S.C. (who received an Oscar for his effects in the film), head of the special effects department at Paramount Pictures, assisted by Paul Lerpae, A.S.C. in Optical Photography (blue screen \"travelling matte\" composites) and Farciot Edouart, A.S.C., in Process Photography (rear projection effects). Fulton\u2019s effects included the building of Sethi\u2019s Jubilee treasure city, the Burning Bush, the fiery hail from a cloudless sky, the Angel of Death, the composites of the Exodus, the Pillar of Fire, the giving of the Ten Commandments, and the tour de force, the parting of the Red Sea. The parting of the Red Sea was considered the most difficult special effect ever performed up to that time. This effect took about six months of VistaVision filming, and combined scenes shot on the shores of the Red Sea in Egypt, with scenes filmed at Paramount Studios in Hollywood of a huge water tank split by a U-shaped trough, into which approximately 360,000 gallons of water were released from the sides, as well as the filming of a giant waterfall also built on the Paramount backlot to create the effect of the walls of the parted sea out of the turbulent backwash. All of the multiple elements of the shot were then combined in Paul Lerpae's optical printer, and matte paintings of rocks by Jan Domela concealed the matte lines between the real elements and the special effects elements. Unlike the technique used by ILM for \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and \"\"Poltergeist\"\" of injecting poster paints into a glass tank containing a salt water inversion layer, the cloud effects for \"The Ten Commandments\" were formed with white Britt smoke filmed against a translucent sky backing, and colors were added optically. Striking portraits of Charlton Heston as Moses and three women in front of menacing clouds were photographed by Wallace Kelly, A.S.C. in Farciot Edouart\u2019s process (rear projection) department, in what are still considered unforgettable scenes. DeMille used these scenes to break up the montage, framing his subjects like a Renaissance master. An abundance of blue screen spillage or \"bleeding\" can be seen, particularly at the top of the superimposed walls of water, but rather than detracting from the shot, this (unintentionally) gives the scene an eerie yet spectacular appearance. The parting of the Red Sea sequence is considered by many to be one of the greatest special effects of all time.\n","DeMille was reluctant to discuss technical details of how the film was made, especially the optical tricks used in the parting of the Red Sea. It was eventually revealed that footage of the Red Sea was spliced with film footage (run in reverse) of water pouring from large U-shaped trip-tanks set up in the studio backlot.\n","Section::::Production.:Music.\n","The score for \"The Ten Commandments\" was composed and conducted by Elmer Bernstein. Initially, DeMille hired Bernstein, then a relatively unknown film composer, to write and record only the diegetic music required for the film's dance sequences and other onscreen musical passages, with the intention of employing frequent collaborator Victor Young to write the score proper. However, Young turned down the assignment due to his own failing health, causing DeMille to hire Bernstein to write the underscore as well.\n","In total, Bernstein composed two and a half hours of music for the film, writing for a full symphony orchestra augmented with various ethnic and unusual instruments such as the shofar, the tiple, and the theremin. The score is written in a highly Romantic style, featuring unique musical leitmotifs for the film's characters (God, Moses, Rameses, Nefretiri, etc.) used in a manner inspired, at DeMille's direction, by the opera scores of Richard Wagner. Bernstein recorded both the diegetic music and the score at the Paramount Studios Recording Stage in sessions spread from April 1955 to August 1956.\n","A double-LP monaural soundtrack album was released in 1957 by Dot Records, utilizing excerpts from the original film recordings. A stereo version of the 1957 album was released in 1960 containing new recordings conducted by Bernstein, as the original film recordings, while recorded in three-channel stereo, were not properly balanced for an LP stereo release, as the intent at the time of recording had been to mix the film masters to mono for the film soundtrack itself; this recording was later issued on CD by MCA Classics in 1989. For the film's tenth anniversary, United Artists Records released a second stereo re-recording in 1966, also conducted by Bernstein and employing different orchestral arrangements unique to this release.\n","For the film's 60th anniversary, Intrada Records released a six-CD album of the score in 2016. The Intrada release contains the complete two and a half hour score as originally recorded by Bernstein, with much of it remixed in true stereo for the first time. In addition, the 2016 release contains all the diegetic music recorded for the film, the original 1957 Dot album (in mono), the 1960 Dot album (in stereo), and the 1966 United Artists album, as well a 12-minute recording of Bernstein auditioning his thematic ideas for DeMille on the piano.\n","Section::::Release.\n","Cecil B. DeMille promoted the film by placing Ten Commandment monuments as a publicity stunt for the film in cities across the United States. \"The Ten Commandments\" premiered at New York City's Criterion Theatre on November 8, 1956. Among those who attended the premiere were Cecil B. DeMille and his daughter Cecilia DeMille Harper, Charlton Heston and his wife Lydia Clarke, Yul Brynner, Anne Baxter, Edward G. Robinson, Yvonne De Carlo and her husband Bob Morgan, Martha Scott and her husband and son, William Holden and his wife Brenda Marshall, John Wayne and his wife Pilar Pallete, Tony Curtis, Janet Leigh, and Barney Balaban. It played on a roadshow basis with reserved seating until mid-1958, when it finally entered general release. It was re-released in 1966 and 1972, and one more time in 1989. The 1972 and 1989 re-issues included 70mm and 35mm prints that reframed the picture's aspect ratio to 2.20:1 and 2.39:1, respectively, cropping the top and bottom of the picture's original 1.85:1 aspect ratio. \"The Ten Commandments\" was released on DVD on March 30, 1999; March 9, 2004, as a Special Collector's Edition; and March 29, 2011, as a Special edition and Standard edition.\n","Section::::Reception.\n","Section::::Reception.:Box office.\n","\"The Ten Commandments\" was the highest-grossing film of 1956 and the second most successful film of the decade. By April 1957, the film had earned an unprecedented $10 million from engagements at just eighty theaters, averaging about $1 million per week, with more than seven million people paying to watch it. During its initial release, it earned theater rentals (the distributor's share of the box office gross) of $31.3 million in North America and $23.9 million from the foreign markets, for a total of $55.2 million (equating to approximately $122.7 million in ticket sales). It was hugely profitable for its era, earning a net profit of $18,500,000, against a production budget of $13.27 million (the most a film had cost up to that point).\n","By the time of its withdrawal from distribution at the end of 1960, \"The Ten Commandments\" had overtaken \"Gone with the Wind\" at the box office in the North American territory, and mounted a serious challenge in the global market\u2014the worldwide takings for \"Gone with the Wind\" were reported to stand at $59 million at the time. \"Gone with the Wind\" would be re-released the following year as part of the American Civil War Centennial, and reasserted its supremacy at the box office by reclaiming the US record. Also at this time, \"Ben-Hur\"\u2014another biblical epic starring Charlton Heston released at the end of 1959\u2014would go on to eclipse \"The Ten Commandments\" at the box office. A 1966 reissue earned $6,000,000, and further re-releases brought the total American theater rentals to $43 million, equivalent to gross ticket sales of $89 million at the box office. Globally, it ultimately collected $90,066,230 in revenues up to 1979.\n","It remains one of the most popular films ever made. Adjusted for inflation, it has earned a box office gross equivalent to $2 billion at 2011 prices, according to \"Guinness World Records\"; only \"Gone with the Wind\" (1939), \"Avatar\" (2009), \"Star Wars\" (1977), \"Titanic\" (1997), \"The Sound of Music\" (1965), and \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\" (1982) have generated higher grosses in constant dollars.\n","Section::::Reception.:Critical response.\n","\"The Ten Commandments\" received generally positive reviews after its release, although some reviewers noted its divergence from the biblical text. Bosley Crowther for \"The New York Times\" was among those who lauded DeMille's work, acknowledging that \"in its remarkable settings and d\u00e9cor, including an overwhelming facade of the Egyptian city from which the Exodus begins, and in the glowing Technicolor in which the picture is filmed\u2014Mr. DeMille has worked photographic wonders.\" \"Variety\" described the \"scenes of the greatness that was Egypt, and Hebrews by the thousands under the whip of the taskmasters\" as \"striking,\" and believed that the film \"hits the peak of beauty with a sequence that is unelaborate, this being the Passover supper wherein Moses is shown with his family while the shadow of death falls on Egyptian first-borns.\"\n","The film's cast was also complimented. \"Variety\" called Charlton Heston an \"adaptable performer\" who, as Moses, reveals \"inner glow as he is called by God to remove the chains of slavery that hold his people.\" It considered Yul Brynner \"expert\" as Rameses, too. Anne Baxter's performance as Nefretiri was criticized by \"Variety\" as leaning \"close to old-school siren histrionics,\" but Crowther believed that it, along with Brynner's, is \"unquestionably apt and complementary to a lusty and melodramatic romance.\" The performances of Yvonne De Carlo and John Derek were acclaimed by Crowther as \"notably good.\" He also commended the film's \"large cast of characters\" as \"very good, from Sir Cedric Hardwicke as a droll and urbane Pharaoh to Edward G. Robinson as a treacherous overlord.\"\n","Leonard Maltin, a contemporary film critic, gave the film four out of four stars and described it as \"vivid storytelling at its best... parting of the Red Sea, writing of the holy tablets are unforgettable highlights.\"\n","Rotten Tomatoes retrospectively collected 32 reviews and reported 97% of critics have given the film a positive review, with an average rating of 7.68\/10. The site's critics consensus states: \"Bombastic and occasionally silly but extravagantly entertaining, Cecil B. DeMille's all-star spectacular is a muscular retelling of the great Bible story.\"\n","The critic Camille Paglia has called \"The Ten Commandments\" one of the ten greatest films of all time.\n","Section::::Reception.:Accolades.\n","\"The Ten Commandments\" won the Academy Award for Best Special Effects (John P. Fulton). It was also nominated for Best Color Art Direction (art directors Hal Pereira, Walter H. Tyler, and Albert Nozaki and set decorators Samuel M. Comer and Ray Moyer), Best Color Cinematography (Loyal Griggs), Best Color Costume Design (Edith Head, Ralph Jester, John Jensen, Dorothy Jeakins, and Arnold Friberg), Best Film Editing (Anne Bauchens), Best Motion Picture (Cecil B. DeMille) and Best Sound Recording (Paramount Studio Sound Department and sound director Loren L. Ryder). Paramount submitted the names of Yvonne De Carlo, John Derek, and Debra Paget for the supporting player categories (even though they received star billing in the film) at the 29th Academy Awards, but the actors did not receive nominations.\n","At the 15th Foreign Language Press Film Critics Circle Awards in New York City, DeMille won Best Director and a special award for Best Picture \"on the basis of [the film's] expression of human ideals and aspirations.\" The circle represented 44 newspapers in 19 languages.\n","For his \"heroic conception\" of \"The Ten Commandments\" and for \"focusing attention on 'the moral law,'\" DeMille received the first Torah Award from the National Women's League of the United Synagogues of America, Pacific Southwest Branch.\n","Father James Keller of the The Christophers presented five special Christopher Awards to DeMille, associate producer Henry Wilcoxon, and screenwriters Aeneas MacKenzie, Jesse L. Lasky Jr., Jack Gariss, and Fredric M. Frank. They were honored \"because of the picture's unique significance in relating eternal truths to modern problems.\"\n","Charlton Heston's performance as Moses was ranked as the 4th Best Performance by a Male Star of 1956 by \"The Film Daily\"'s Filmdom's Famous Five Poll. Heston was also nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Performance by an Actor in a Motion Picture - Drama and later won the Fotograma de Plata Award for Best Foreign Performer in 1959.\n","Yul Brynner won the National Board of Review Award for Best Actor for his performance as Rameses.\n","Cecil B. DeMille won many special awards for the film. He received, among others, the \"Los Angeles Examiner\" Award, the \"Boxoffice\" Blue Ribbon Award for the Best Picture of the Month (January 1957), the \"Photoplay\" Achievement Award, and \"The Christian Herald\"'s Reader's Award for the Picture of the Year (1957).\n","The Maryland State Council of the American Jewish Congress awarded the Stephen S. Wise Medallion to DeMille for \"most inspiring film of the year.\" Charlton Heston, Yul Brynner, Edward G. Robinson, Sir Cedric Hardwicke, Nina Foch, and Martha Scott also received awards for their acting.\n","The film was also included in several of the annual top ten film lists, such as those featured in \"The Film Daily\" and \"Photoplay\".\n","The American Film Institute included the film as #10 in the epic film category in AFI's 10 Top 10, #79 in AFI's 100 Years...100 Cheers, and named Moses as the #43 hero in AFI's 100 Years...100 Heroes and Villains.\n","Section::::Popularity.\n","Critics have argued that considerable liberties were taken with the biblical story of Exodus, compromising the film's claim to authenticity, but neither this nor its nearly four-hour length has had any effect on its popularity. In fact, many of the supposed inaccuracies were actually adopted by DeMille from extra-biblical ancient sources, such as Josephus, the Sepher ha-Yashar, and the Chronicle of Moses. Moses's career in Ethiopia, for instance, is based on ancient midrashim. For decades, a showing of \"The Ten Commandments\" was a popular fundraiser among revivalist Christian Churches, while the film was equally treasured by film buffs for DeMille's \"cast of thousands\" approach and the heroic but antiquated early-talkie-type acting.\n","Section::::Home media.\n","\"The Ten Commandments\" has been released on DVD in the United States on four occasions: the first edition (Widescreen Collection) was released on March 30, 1999 as a two-disc set, the second edition (Special Collector's Edition) was released on March 9, 2004, as a two-disc set with commentary by Katherine Orrison, the third edition (50th Anniversary Collection) was released on March 21, 2006 as a three-disc set with the 1923 version and special features, and the fourth edition (55th Anniversary Edition) was released on DVD again in a two-disc set on March 29, 2011, and for the first time on Blu-ray in a two-disc set and a six-disc limited edition gift set with the 1923 version and DVD copies. In 2012, the limited edition gift set won the Home Media Award for Best Packaging (Paramount Pictures and Johns Byrne).\n","Section::::Television broadcast.\n","\"The Ten Commandments\" was first broadcast on the ABC network on February 18, 1973, and has aired annually on the network since then, with the exception of 1999, traditionally during the Passover and Easter holidays. Since 2006 the network has typically aired \"The Ten Commandments\" on the Saturday night prior to Easter, with the broadcast starting at 7:00\u00a0p.m. in the Eastern and Pacific Time Zones and 6:00\u00a0p.m. Central and Mountain. The film is the only pre-scheduled \"ABC Saturday Movie of the Week\" of the year.\n","Unlike many lengthy films of the day, which were usually broken up into separate airings over at least two nights, ABC elected to show \"The Ten Commandments\" in one night and has done so every year it has carried the film, with one exception; in 1997, ABC elected to split the movie in two and aired half of it in its normal Easter Sunday slot, which that year was March 30, with the second half airing on Monday, March 31 as counterprogramming to the other networks' offerings, which included CBS' coverage of the NCAA Men's Basketball Championship Game.\n","The length of the film combined with the necessary advertisement breaks has caused its broadcast window to vary over the years, and today, ABC's total run time for \"The Ten Commandments\" stands at four hours and forty-four minutes. This requires the network to overrun into the 11:00\u00a0p.m. (10:00\u00a0p.m. CT\/MT) timeslot that belongs to the local affiliates, thus delaying their late local news and any other programming the station may air in the overnight hours (with some stations forgoing a late newscast entirely and giving personnel the evening off). When the film has aired on Easter Sunday, affiliates have been given the ability to tape delay the showing an hour ahead to 8\u00a0p.m. ET\/PT to keep their schedules in line for early evening, though at the cost of delaying their local newscasts to 12:45\u00a0a.m. (11:45\u00a0p.m. CT\/MT).\n","In 2010, the film was broadcast in high definition for the first time, which allowed the television audience to see it in its original VistaVision aspect ratio. In 2015, for the first time in several years, the network undertook a one-off airing of the film on Easter Sunday night, which fell on April 5.\n","BULLET::::- Ratings by year (since 2007)\n","Section::::See also.\n","BULLET::::- List of films based on the Bible\n","BULLET::::- List of American films of 1956\n","BULLET::::- \"The Prince of Egypt\"\n","BULLET::::- List of films featuring slavery\n","Section::::External links.\n","BULLET::::- Production design drawings for \"The Ten Commandments\", Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\n","BULLET::::- Costume design drawings for \"The Ten Commandments\", Margaret Herrick Library, Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences\n"]},"anchors":{"paragraph_id":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,6,7,7,7,7,7,8,8,9,10,11,11,11,11,11,11,12,12,13,13,14,14,14,15,15,15,17,19,20,20,21,21,22,22,23,23,24,24,25,26,26,27,27,28,28,29,29,30,31,32,32,33,33,34,34,35,35,36,37,37,38,38,39,39,40,40,41,41,42,42,45,46,47,48,48,49,49,50,50,51,52,53,54,55,59,59,59,59,59,59,59,59,59,59,59,61,61,61,61,61,62,62,63,63,63,63,63,63,63,63,63,63,63,63,63,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,65,65,65,65,65,65,65,66,66,66,66,66,66,66,67,68,68,68,68,68,71,71,71,71,71,72,72,72,73,73,73,73,74,75,76,76,76,76,76,76,76,76,79,79,79,79,79,79,79,79,79,79,79,79,79,79,79,79,80,80,82,82,82,83,83,83,83,83,83,84,84,84,84,85,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,87,90,90,90,91,91,91,92,92,92,92,92,92,92,92,92,94,94,94,96,97,97,98,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,100,102,103,103,103,103,103,103,103,103,104,104,104,104,104,105,105,105,106,106,106,107,107,107,107,107,109,109,109,109,111,111,111,111,113,113,113,115,115,115,115,115,115,115,115,116,116,117,118,121,122,123,124,126,127],"start":[40,45,55,102,128,150,180,242,285,322,344,398,428,446,552,566,603,612,645,679,694,703,718,729,751,759,778,787,813,827,848,872,879,892,901,917,927,958,22,29,49,150,42,68,94,133,149,278,301,401,495,511,706,785,854,923,69,99,204,242,0,8,21,59,73,144,150,317,73,131,244,289,318,31,65,150,333,51,94,145,242,333,363,94,101,82,457,54,114,133,58,93,182,62,14,12,31,12,27,12,27,12,34,12,31,12,12,26,12,36,12,25,12,28,12,12,12,30,12,29,12,34,12,29,12,12,28,12,29,12,31,12,28,12,26,12,54,12,12,12,12,25,12,28,12,38,27,44,27,12,37,41,59,79,96,177,220,268,381,397,442,455,0,60,105,178,193,22,97,12,118,129,144,156,172,185,201,217,229,243,261,439,0,13,28,41,56,72,103,118,148,158,189,203,235,264,277,289,357,459,521,528,677,0,17,67,96,142,174,218,24,56,122,143,176,208,228,22,57,77,170,189,236,202,503,847,904,926,130,325,455,37,60,89,165,40,223,41,49,56,67,84,382,428,447,75,91,115,193,225,282,316,344,365,821,1160,1328,1349,1377,1512,1542,119,190,67,190,336,177,189,204,247,288,438,12,62,131,570,33,0,77,127,165,178,276,334,363,377,390,403,423,467,505,533,550,574,589,602,619,650,1057,31,349,397,106,404,531,52,92,164,224,241,261,279,312,380,147,168,482,0,0,128,11,31,71,114,154,167,188,221,241,253,280,295,322,334,348,361,382,399,418,434,455,477,552,602,619,635,744,86,0,27,67,117,151,169,189,206,0,33,105,183,206,0,20,89,86,120,205,34,177,197,219,234,4,82,106,171,349,389,471,573,44,297,598,50,187,200,370,382,415,427,473,494,515,380,35,12,12,13,12,12,12],"end":[44,54,65,118,139,161,198,263,298,334,358,406,433,454,562,577,606,628,660,690,701,714,727,747,757,774,785,798,823,833,868,877,888,899,913,925,942,971,27,40,64,184,56,80,131,147,155,296,357,446,504,525,718,807,893,945,91,118,227,253,7,17,26,65,81,148,157,322,81,140,249,295,328,37,72,156,339,57,104,151,249,345,374,99,107,87,467,61,128,150,74,110,193,68,28,27,36,23,37,23,36,30,40,27,38,23,22,32,32,41,21,32,24,36,27,25,26,35,25,35,30,40,25,35,26,24,34,25,34,27,44,24,37,22,34,25,67,25,23,31,21,34,24,35,26,46,34,48,32,25,44,57,77,90,112,198,240,290,395,402,450,463,15,86,110,191,205,28,111,21,127,142,154,170,183,199,215,227,241,255,272,450,11,26,39,54,70,85,116,130,156,169,201,216,248,275,287,301,364,474,524,536,689,12,34,74,109,151,188,229,36,67,138,156,191,224,235,35,73,89,184,200,250,207,517,857,922,945,150,331,502,56,81,94,173,52,227,47,54,61,71,96,393,443,454,89,97,120,211,236,298,331,363,380,832,1167,1343,1364,1387,1535,1555,141,197,82,204,348,183,194,212,255,297,452,20,73,137,592,48,16,92,140,174,191,292,349,375,388,401,421,438,479,519,548,560,587,600,613,633,658,1060,60,364,407,124,433,538,74,148,186,230,250,268,297,338,396,162,186,489,14,15,142,25,69,85,138,165,182,201,236,250,278,292,320,332,346,359,376,396,416,431,453,471,497,566,617,629,646,763,99,19,43,84,131,167,187,200,222,15,38,119,201,262,11,65,96,114,183,214,58,195,217,228,246,27,97,134,212,357,407,478,589,47,314,605,53,195,206,377,399,422,435,503,497,554,390,50,44,42,32,43,65,62],"text":["epic","religious","drama film","Cecil B.

{"kilt_id":"23041","wikipedia_id":"23041","wikipedia_title":"Puerto Rico","text":{"paragraph":["Puerto Rico\n","Puerto Rico (), officially the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico (, ) and briefly called Porto Rico, is an unincorporated territory of the United States located in the northeast Caribbean Sea, approximately southeast of Miami, Florida.\n","An archipelago among the Greater Antilles, Puerto Rico includes the eponymous main island and several smaller islands, such as Mona, Culebra, and Vieques. The capital and most populous city is San Juan. The territory's total population is approximately 3.4\u00a0million. Spanish and English are the official languages of the executive branch of government, though Spanish predominates.\n","Originally populated by the indigenous Ta\u00edno people, Puerto Rico was colonized by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493. It was contested by the French, Dutch, and British, but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries. The island's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population, the forced migration of African slaves, and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia. In the Spanish Empire, Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain. Spain's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century, producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous, African, and European elements. On September 23, 1868, Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances unleashed a revolt against Spanish rule, declaring for the first time the idea of Puerto Rico as a distinct people, with right to sovereignty. This revolt, known as El Grito de Lares, was eventually put down by Spanish forces, but the movement continued. In 1898, following the Spanish\u2013American War, the United States acquired Puerto Rico under the terms of the Treaty of Paris. Since then, Puerto Rico has remained an unincorporated territorial possession, making it one of the oldest colonies in the Western Hemisphere. \n","Puerto Ricans have been citizens of the United States since 1917, and enjoy freedom of movement between the island and the mainland. As it is not a state, Puerto Rico does not have a vote in the United States Congress, which governs the territory with full jurisdiction under the Puerto Rico Federal Relations Act of 1950. However, Puerto Rico does have one non-voting member of the House called a Resident Commissioner. As residents of a U.S. territory, American citizens in Puerto Rico are disenfranchised at the national level and do not vote for president and vice president of the United States, nor pay federal income tax on Puerto Rican income. Like other territories and the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico does not have U.S. senators. Congress approved a local constitution in 1952, allowing U.S. citizens of the territory to elect a governor. Puerto Rico's future political status has consistently been a matter of significant debate.\n","In early 2017, the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government. The outstanding bond debt had climbed to $70\u00a0billion at a time with 12.4% unemployment. The debt had been increasing during a decade long recession. This was the second major financial crisis to affect the island after the Great Depression when the U.S. government, in 1935, provided relief efforts through the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration. On May 3, 2017, Puerto Rico's financial oversight board in the U.S. District Court for Puerto Rico filed the debt restructuring petition which was made under Title III of PROMESA. By early August 2017, the debt was $72 billion with a 45% poverty rate.\n","In late September 2017, Hurricane Maria made landfall in Puerto Rico, causing devastating damage. The island's electrical grid was largely destroyed, provoking the largest power outage in American history. Recovery efforts were slow in the first few months, and over 200,000 residents had moved to the mainland State of Florida alone by late November 2017.\n","Section::::Etymology.\n","Puerto Rico is Spanish for \"rich port\". Puerto Ricans often call the island \u2013 a derivation of , its indigenous Ta\u00edno name, which means \"Land of the Valiant Lord\". The terms and derive from and respectively, and are commonly used to identify someone of Puerto Rican heritage. The island is also popularly known in Spanish as , meaning \"the island of enchantment\".\n","Columbus named the island , in honor of Saint John the Baptist, while the capital city was named (\"Rich Port City\"). Eventually traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico, while San Juan became the name used for the main trading\/shipping port and the capital city.\n","The island's name was changed to \"Porto Rico\" by the United States after the Treaty of Paris of 1898. The anglicized name was used by the U.S. government and private enterprises. The name was changed back to Puerto Rico by a joint resolution in Congress introduced by F\u00e9lix C\u00f3rdova D\u00e1vila in 1931.\n","The official name of the entity in Spanish is (\"free associated state of Puerto Rico\"), while its official English name is Commonwealth of Puerto Rico.\n","Section::::History.\n","Section::::History.:Pre-Columbian era.\n","The ancient history of the archipelago which is now Puerto Rico is not well known. Unlike other indigenous cultures in the New World (Aztec, Maya and Inca) which left behind abundant archeological and physical evidence of their societies, scant artifacts and evidence remain of the Puerto Rico's indigenous population. Scarce archaeological findings and early Spanish accounts from the colonial era constitute all that is known about them. The first comprehensive book on the history of Puerto Rico was written by Fray \u00cd\u00f1igo Abbad y Lasierra in 1786, nearly three centuries after the first Spaniards landed on the island.\n","The first known settlers were the Ortoiroid people, an Archaic Period culture of Amerindian hunters and fishermen who migrated from the South American mainland. Some scholars suggest their settlement dates back about 4,000 years. An archeological dig in 1990 on the island of Vieques found the remains of a man, designated as the \"Puerto Ferro Man\", which was dated to around 2000 BC. The Ortoiroid were displaced by the Saladoid, a culture from the same region that arrived on the island between 430 and 250 BC.\n","The Igneri tribe migrated to Puerto Rico between 120 and 400\u00a0AD from the region of the Orinoco river in northern South America. The Arcaico and Igneri co-existed on the island between the 4th and 10th centuries.\n","Between the 7th and 11th centuries, the Ta\u00edno culture developed on the island. By approximately 1000\u00a0AD, it had become dominant. At the time of Columbus' arrival, an estimated 30,000 to 60,000 Ta\u00edno Amerindians, led by the \"cacique\" (chief) Ag\u00fceyban\u00e1, inhabited the island. They called it \"Boriken\", meaning \"the great land of the valiant and noble Lord\". The natives lived in small villages, each led by a cacique. They subsisted by hunting and fishing, done generally by men, as well as by the women's gathering and processing of indigenous cassava root and fruit. This lasted until Columbus arrived in 1493.\n","Section::::History.:Spanish colony (1493\u20131898).\n","Section::::History.:Spanish colony (1493\u20131898).:Conquest and early settlement.\n","When Columbus arrived in Puerto Rico during his second voyage on November 19, 1493, the island was inhabited by the Ta\u00edno. They called it \"Borik\u00e9n\" (\"Borinquen\" in Spanish transliteration). Columbus named the island San Juan Bautista, in honor of St John the Baptist. Having reported the findings of his first travel, Columbus brought with him this time a letter from King Ferdinand empowered by a papal bull that authorized any course of action necessary for the expansion of the Spanish Empire and the Christian faith. Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n, a lieutenant under Columbus, founded the first Spanish settlement, Caparra, on August 8, 1508. He later served as the first governor of the island. Eventually, traders and other maritime visitors came to refer to the entire island as Puerto Rico, and San Juan became the name of the main trading\/shipping port.\n","At the beginning of the 16th century, the Spanish people began to colonize the island. Despite the Laws of Burgos of 1512 and other decrees for the protection of the indigenous population, some Ta\u00edno Indians were forced into an encomienda system of forced labor in the early years of colonization. The population suffered extremely high fatalities from epidemics of European infectious diseases.\n","Section::::History.:Spanish colony (1493\u20131898).:Colonization, the Habsburgs.\n","In 1520, King Charles I of Spain issued a royal decree collectively emancipating the remaining Ta\u00edno population. By that time, the Ta\u00edno people were few in number. Enslaved Africans had already begun to be imported to compensate for the native labor loss, but their numbers were proportionate to the diminished commercial interest Spain soon began to demonstrate for the island colony. Other nearby islands, like Cuba, Saint-Domingue, and Guadeloupe, attracted more of the slave trade than Puerto Rico, probably because of greater agricultural interests in those islands, on which colonists had developed large sugar plantations and had the capital to invest in the Atlantic slave trade.\n","From the beginning of the country, the colonial administration relied heavily on the industry of enslaved Africans and creole blacks for public works and defenses, primarily in coastal ports and cities, where the tiny colonial population had hunkered down. With no significant industries or large-scale agricultural production as yet, enslaved and free communities lodged around the few littoral settlements, particularly around San Juan, also forming lasting Afro-creole communities. Meanwhile, in the island's interior, there developed a mixed and independent peasantry that relied on a subsistence economy. This mostly unsupervised population supplied villages and settlements with foodstuffs and, in relative isolation, set the pattern for what later would be known as the Puerto Rican J\u00edbaro culture. By the end of the 16th century, the Spanish Empire was diminishing and, in the face of increasing raids from European competitors, the colonial administration throughout the Americas fell into a \"bunker mentality\". Imperial strategists and urban planners redesigned port settlements into military posts with the objective of protecting Spanish territorial claims and ensuring the safe passing of the king's silver-laden Atlantic Fleet to the Iberian Peninsula. San Juan served as an important port-of-call for ships driven across the Atlantic by its powerful trade winds. West Indies convoys linked Spain to the island, sailing between C\u00e1diz and the Spanish West Indies. The colony's seat of government was on the forested Islet of San Juan and for a time became one of the most heavily fortified settlements in the Spanish Caribbean earning the name of the \"Walled City\". The islet is still dotted with the various forts and walls, such as La Fortaleza, Castillo San Felipe del Morro, and Castillo San Crist\u00f3bal, designed to protect the population and the strategic Port of San Juan from the raids of the Spanish European competitors.\n","In 1625, in the Battle of San Juan, the Dutch commander Boudewijn Hendricksz tested the defenses' limits like no one else before. Learning from Francis Drake's previous failures here, he circumvented the cannons of the castle of San Felipe del Morro and quickly brought his 17 ships into the San Juan Bay. He then occupied the port and attacked the city while the population hurried for shelter behind the Morro's moat and high battlements. Historians consider this event the worst attack on San Juan. Though the Dutch set the village on fire, they failed to conquer the Morro, and its batteries pounded their troops and ships until Hendricksz deemed the cause lost. Hendricksz's expedition eventually helped propel a fortification frenzy. Constructions of defenses for the San Crist\u00f3bal Hill were soon ordered so as to prevent the landing of invaders out of reach of the Morro's artillery. Urban planning responded to the needs of keeping the colony in Spanish hands.\n","Section::::History.:Spanish colony (1493\u20131898).:Late colonial period.\n","During the late 16th and early 17th centuries, Spain concentrated its colonial efforts on the more prosperous mainland North, Central, and South American colonies. With the advent of the lively Bourbon Dynasty in Spain in the 1700s, the island of Puerto Rico began a gradual shift to more imperial attention. More roads began connecting previously isolated inland settlements to coastal cities, and coastal settlements like Arecibo, Mayaguez, and Ponce began acquiring importance of their own, separate from San Juan. By the end of the 18th century, merchant ships from an array of nationalities threatened the tight regulations of the Mercantilist system, which turned each colony solely toward the European metropole and limited contact with other nations. U.S. ships came to surpass Spanish trade and with this also came the exploitation of the island's natural resources. Slavers, which had made but few stops on the island before, began selling more enslaved Africans to growing sugar and coffee plantations. The increasing number of Atlantic wars in which the Caribbean islands played major roles, like the War of Jenkins' Ear, the Seven Years' War and the Atlantic Revolutions, ensured Puerto Rico's growing esteem in Madrid's eyes. On April 17, 1797, Sir Ralph Abercromby's fleet invaded the island with a force of 6,000\u201313,000 men, which included German soldiers and Royal Marines and 60 to 64 ships. Fierce fighting continued for the next days with Spanish troops. Both sides suffered heavy losses. On Sunday April 30 the British ceased their attack and began their retreat from San Juan. By the time independence movements in the larger Spanish colonies gained success, new waves of loyal creole immigrants began to arrive in Puerto Rico, helping to tilt the island's political balance toward the Crown.\n","In 1809, to secure its political bond with the island and in the midst of the European Peninsular War, the Supreme Central Junta based in C\u00e1diz recognized Puerto Rico as an overseas province of Spain. This gave the island residents the right to elect representatives to the recently convened Spanish parliament (C\u00e1diz Cortes), with equal representation to mainland Iberian, Mediterranean (Balearic Islands) and Atlantic maritime Spanish provinces (Canary Islands).\n","Ram\u00f3n Power y Giralt, the first Spanish parliamentary representative from the island of Puerto Rico, died after serving a three-year term in the Cortes. These parliamentary and constitutional reforms were in force from 1810 to 1814, and again from 1820 to 1823. They were twice reversed during the restoration of the traditional monarchy by Ferdinand VII. Immigration and commercial trade reforms in the 19th century increased the island's ethnic European population and economy and expanded the Spanish cultural and social imprint on the local character of the island.\n","Minor slave revolts had occurred on the island throughout the years, with the revolt planned and organized by Marcos Xiorro in 1821 being the most important. Even though the conspiracy was unsuccessful, Xiorro achieved legendary status and is part of Puerto Rico's folklore.\n","Section::::History.:Spanish colony (1493\u20131898).:Politics of liberalism.\n","In the early 19th century, Puerto Rico spawned an independence movement that, due to harsh persecution by the Spanish authorities, convened in the island of St. Thomas. The movement was largely inspired by the ideals of Sim\u00f3n Bol\u00edvar in establishing a United Provinces of New Granada and Venezuela, that included Puerto Rico and Cuba. Among the influential members of this movement were Brigadier General Antonio Valero de Bernab\u00e9 and Mar\u00eda de las Mercedes Barbudo. The movement was discovered, and Governor Miguel de la Torre had its members imprisoned or exiled.\n","With the increasingly rapid growth of independent former Spanish colonies in the South and Central American states in the first part of the 19th century, the Spanish Crown considered Puerto Rico and Cuba of strategic importance. To increase its hold on its last two New World colonies, the Spanish Crown revived the Royal Decree of Graces of 1815 as a result of which 450,000 immigrants, mainly Spaniards, settled on the island in the period up until the American conquest. Printed in three languages\u2014Spanish, English, and French\u2014it was intended to also attract non-Spanish Europeans, with the hope that the independence movements would lose their popularity if new settlers had stronger ties to the Crown. Hundreds of non-Spanish families, mainly from Corsica, France, Germany, Ireland, Italy and Scotland, also immigrated to the island.\n","Free land was offered as an incentive to those who wanted to populate the two islands, on the condition that they swear their loyalty to the Spanish Crown and allegiance to the Roman Catholic Church. The offer was very successful, and European immigration continued even after 1898. Puerto Rico still receives Spanish and European immigration.\n","Poverty and political estrangement with Spain led to a small but significant uprising in 1868 known as \"Grito de Lares.\" It began in the rural town of Lares, but was subdued when rebels moved to the neighboring town of San Sebasti\u00e1n.\n","Leaders of this independence movement included Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances, considered the \"father\" of the Puerto Rican independence movement, and other political figures such as Segundo Ruiz Belvis. Slavery was abolished in Puerto Rico in 1873, \"with provisions for periods of apprenticeship\".\n","Leaders of \"El Grito de Lares\" went into exile in New York City. Many joined the Puerto Rican Revolutionary Committee, founded on December 8, 1895, and continued their quest for Puerto Rican independence. In 1897, Antonio Mattei Lluberas and the local leaders of the independence movement in Yauco organized another uprising, which became known as the \"Intentona de Yauco\". They raised what they called the Puerto Rican flag, which was adopted as the national flag. The local conservative political factions opposed independence. Rumors of the planned event spread to the local Spanish authorities who acted swiftly and put an end to what would be the last major uprising in the island to Spanish colonial rule.\n","In 1897, Luis Mu\u00f1oz Rivera and others persuaded the liberal Spanish government to agree to grant limited self-government to the island by royal decree in the Autonomic Charter, including a bicameral legislature. In 1898, Puerto Rico's first, but short-lived, quasi-autonomous government was organized as an \"overseas province\" of Spain. This bilaterally agreed-upon charter maintained a governor appointed by the King of Spain \u2013 who held the power to annul any legislative decision \u2013 and a partially elected parliamentary structure. In February, Governor-General Manuel Mac\u00edas inaugurated the new government under the Autonomic Charter. General elections were held in March and the new government began to function on July 17, 1898.\n","Section::::History.:American colony (1898\u2013present).\n","In 1890, Captain Alfred Thayer Mahan, a member of the Navy War Board and leading U.S. strategic thinker, published a book titled \"The Influence of Sea Power upon History\" in which he argued for the establishment of a large and powerful navy modeled after the British Royal Navy. Part of his strategy called for the acquisition of colonies in the Caribbean, which would serve as coaling and naval stations. They would serve as strategic points of defense with the construction of a canal through the Isthmus of Panama, to allow easier passage of ships between the Atlantic and Pacific oceans.\n","William H. Seward, the former Secretary of State under presidents Abraham Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, had also stressed the importance of building a canal in Honduras, Nicaragua or Panama. He suggested that the United States annex the Dominican Republic and purchase Puerto Rico and Cuba. The U.S. Senate did not approve his annexation proposal, and Spain rejected the U.S. offer of dollars for Puerto Rico and Cuba.\n","Since 1894, the United States Naval War College had been developing contingency plans for a war with Spain. By 1896, the U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence had prepared a plan that included military operations in Puerto Rican waters. Except for one 1895 plan, which recommended annexation of the island then named \"Isle of Pines\" (later renamed as Isla de la Juventud), a recommendation dropped in later planning, plans developed for attacks on Spanish territories were intended as support operations against Spain's forces in and around Cuba. Recent research suggests that the U.S. did consider Puerto Rico valuable as a naval station, and recognized that it and Cuba generated lucrative crops of sugar \u2013 a valuable commercial commodity which the United States lacked, before the development of the sugar beet industry in the United States.\n","On July 25, 1898, during the Spanish\u2013American War, the U.S. invaded Puerto Rico with a landing at Gu\u00e1nica. As an outcome of the war, Spain ceded Puerto Rico, along with the Philippines and Guam, then under Spanish sovereignty, to the U.S. under the Treaty of Paris, which went into effect on April 11, 1899. Spain relinquished sovereignty over Cuba, but did not cede it to the U.S.\n","Section::::History.:American colony (1898\u2013present).:United States unincorporated organized territory (1900\u20131952).\n","The United States and Puerto Rico began a long-standing metropolis-colony relationship. In the early 20th century, Puerto Rico was ruled by the military, with officials including the governor appointed by the president of the United States. The Foraker Act of 1900 gave Puerto Rico a certain amount of civilian popular government, including a popularly elected House of Representatives. The upper house and governor were appointed by the United States.\n","Its judicial system was reformed to bring it into conformity with the American legal system; a Puerto Rico Supreme Court and a United State District Court for the territory were established. It was authorized a non-voting member of Congress, by the title of \"Resident Commissioner\", who was appointed. In addition, this Act extended all U.S. laws \"not locally inapplicable\" to Puerto Rico, specifying, in particular, exemption from U.S. Internal Revenue laws.\n","The Act empowered the civil government to legislate on \"all matters of legislative character not locally inapplicable\", including the power to modify and repeal any laws then in existence in Puerto Rico, though the U.S. Congress retained the power to annul acts of the Puerto Rico legislature. During an address to the Puerto Rican legislature in 1906, President Theodore Roosevelt recommended that Puerto Ricans become U.S. citizens.\n","In 1914, the Puerto Rican House of Delegates voted unanimously in favor of independence from the United States, but this was rejected by the U.S. Congress as \"unconstitutional\", and in violation of the 1900 Foraker Act.\n","Section::::History.:American colony (1898\u2013present).:U.S. citizenship and Puerto Rican citizenship.\n","In 1917, the U.S. Congress passed the Jones\u2013Shafroth Act (popularly known as the Jones Act), which granted Puerto Ricans born on or after April 25, 1898, U.S. citizenship. Opponents, including all of the Puerto Rican House of Delegates (who voted unanimously against it), claimed that the U.S. imposed citizenship in order to draft Puerto Rican men into the army as American entry into World War I as the likely motive.\n","The same Act provided for a popularly elected Senate to complete a bicameral Legislative Assembly, as well as a bill of rights. It authorized the popular election of the Resident Commissioner to a four-year term.\n","Natural disasters, including a major earthquake and tsunami in 1918 and several hurricanes, as well as the Great Depression, impoverished the island during the first few decades under U.S. rule. Some political leaders, such as Pedro Albizu Campos, who led the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, demanded a change in relations with the United States. He organized a protest at the University of Puerto Rico in 1935, in which four were killed by police.\n","In 1936, U.S. senator Millard Tydings introduced a bill supporting independence for Puerto Rico, but it was opposed by Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn of the Liberal Party of Puerto Rico. (Tydings had co-sponsored the Tydings\u2013McDuffie Act, which provided independence to the Philippines following a 10-year transition period of limited autonomy.) All the Puerto Rican political parties supported the bill, but Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn opposed it. Tydings did not achieve passage of the bill.\n","In 1937, Albizu Campos' party organized a protest in which numerous people were killed by police in Ponce. The Insular Police, similar to the National Guard, opened fire upon unarmed cadets and bystanders alike. The attack on unarmed protesters was reported by the U.S. Congressman Vito Marcantonio and confirmed by a report from the Hays Commission, which investigated the events, led by Arthur Garfield Hays, counsel to the American Civil Liberties Union.\n","Nineteen people were killed and over 200 were badly wounded, many in shot in the back while running away. The Hays Commission declared it a massacre and police mob action, and it has since become known as the Ponce massacre. In the aftermath, on April 2, 1943, Tydings introduced a bill in Congress calling for independence for Puerto Rico. This bill ultimately was defeated.\n","During the latter years of the Roosevelt\u2013Truman administrations, the internal governance of the island was changed in a compromise reached with Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn and other Puerto Rican leaders. In 1946, President Truman appointed the first Puerto Rican-born governor, Jes\u00fas T. Pi\u00f1ero.\n","Since 2007, the Puerto Rico State Department has developed a protocol to issue certificates of Puerto Rican citizenship to Puerto Ricans. In order to be eligible, applicants must have been born in Puerto Rico, born outside of Puerto Rico to a Puerto Rican\u2013born parent, or be an American citizen with at least one year of residence in Puerto Rico.\n","Section::::History.:American colony (1898\u2013present).:United States unincorporated organized territory with commonwealth constitution (1952\u2013present).\n","In 1947, the U.S. granted Puerto Ricans the right to democratically elect their own governor. In 1948, Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn became the first popularly elected governor of Puerto Rico.\n","A bill was introduced before the Puerto Rican Senate which would restrain the rights of the independence and nationalist movements in the island. The Senate at the time was controlled by the Popular Democratic Party (PPD), and was presided over by Luis Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn. The bill, also known as the Gag Law (), was approved by the legislature on May 21, 1948. It made it illegal to display a Puerto Rican flag, to sing a pro-independence tune, to talk of independence, or to campaign for independence.\n","The bill, which resembled the Smith Act passed in the United States, was signed and made into law on June 10, 1948, by the U.S. appointed governor of Puerto Rico, Jes\u00fas T. Pi\u00f1ero, and became known as \"Law 53\" ().\n","In accordance with this law, it would be a crime to print, publish, sell, exhibit, organize or help anyone organize any society, group or assembly of people whose intentions are to paralyze or destroy the insular government. Anyone accused and found guilty of disobeying the law could be sentenced to ten years of prison, be fined $10,000 (U.S.), or both. According to Dr. Leopoldo Figueroa, a member of the Puerto Rico House of Representatives, the law was repressive and in violation of the First Amendment of the U.S. Constitution, which guarantees Freedom of Speech. He asserted that the law as such was a violation of the civil rights of the people of Puerto Rico. The law was repealed in 1957.\n","Section::::History.:American colony (1898\u2013present).:\"Estado Libre Asociado\".\n","In 1950, the U.S. Congress granted Puerto Ricans the right to organize a constitutional convention via a referendum that gave them the option of voting their preference, \"yes\" or \"no\", on a proposed U.S. law that would organize Puerto Rico as a \"commonwealth\" that would continue United States sovereignty over Puerto Rico and its people. Puerto Rico's electorate expressed its support for this measure in 1951 with a second referendum to ratify the constitution. The Constitution of Puerto Rico was formally adopted on July 3, 1952. The Constitutional Convention specified the name by which the body politic would be known.\n","On February 4, 1952, the convention approved Resolution 22 which chose in English the word \"Commonwealth\", meaning a \"politically organized community\" or \"state\", which is simultaneously connected by a compact or treaty to another political system. Puerto Rico officially designates itself with the term \"Commonwealth of Puerto Rico\" in its constitution, as a translation into English of the term to \"Estado Libre Asociado\" (ELA).\n","In 1967 Puerto Rico's Legislative Assembly polled the political preferences of the Puerto Rican electorate by passing a plebiscite act that provided for a vote on the status of Puerto Rico. This constituted the first plebiscite by the Legislature for a choice among three status options (commonwealth, statehood, and independence). In subsequent plebiscites organized by Puerto Rico held in 1993 and 1998 (without any formal commitment on the part of the U.S. government to honor the results), the current political status failed to receive majority support. In 1993, Commonwealth status won by a plurality of votes (48.6% versus 46.3% for statehood), while the \"none of the above\" option, which was the Popular Democratic Party-sponsored choice, won in 1998 with 50.3% of the votes (versus 46.5% for statehood). Disputes arose as to the definition of each of the ballot alternatives, and Commonwealth advocates, among others, reportedly urged a vote for \"none of the above\".\n","In 1950, the U.S. Congress approved Public Law 600 (P.L. 81-600), which allowed for a democratic referendum in Puerto Rico to determine whether Puerto Ricans desired to draft their own local constitution. This Act was meant to be adopted in the \"nature of a compact\". It required congressional approval of the Puerto Rico Constitution before it could go into effect, and repealed certain sections of the Organic Act of 1917. The sections of this statute left in force were entitled the \"Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act\". U.S. Secretary of the Interior Oscar L. Chapman, under whose Department resided responsibility of Puerto Rican affairs, clarified the new commonwealth status in this manner:\n","On October 30, 1950, Pedro Albizu Campos and other nationalists led a three-day revolt against the United States in various cities and towns of Puerto Rico, in what is known as the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party Revolts of the 1950s. The most notable occurred in Jayuya and Utuado. In the Jayuya revolt, known as the Jayuya uprising, the Puerto Rican governor declared martial law, and attacked the insurgents in Jayuya with infantry, artillery and bombers under control of the Puerto Rican commander. The Utuado uprising culminated in what is known as the Utuado massacre.\n","On November 1, 1950, Puerto Rican nationalists from New York City, Griselio Torresola and Oscar Collazo, attempted to assassinate President Harry S. Truman at his temporary residence of Blair House. Torresola was killed during the attack, but Collazo was wounded and captured. He was convicted of murder and sentenced to death, but President Truman commuted his sentence to life. After Collazo served 29 years in a federal prison, President Jimmy Carter commuted his sentence to times served and he was released in 1979.\n","Pedro Albizu Campos served many years in a federal prison in Atlanta, for seditious conspiracy to overthrow the U.S. government in Puerto Rico.\n","The Constitution of Puerto Rico was approved by a Constitutional Convention on February 6, 1952, and 82% of the voters in a March referendum. It was modified and ratified by the U.S. Congress, approved by President Truman on July 3 of that year, and proclaimed by Gov. Mu\u00f1oz Mar\u00edn on July 25, 1952. This was the anniversary of July 25, 1898, landing of U.S. troops in the Puerto Rican Campaign of the Spanish\u2013American War, until then celebrated as an annual Puerto Rico holiday.\n","Puerto Rico adopted the name of \"Estado Libre Asociado de Puerto Rico\" (literally \"Associated Free State of Puerto Rico\"), officially translated into English as Commonwealth, for its body politic. \"The United States Congress legislates over many fundamental aspects of Puerto Rican life, including citizenship, the currency, the postal service, foreign policy, military defense, communications, labor relations, the environment, commerce, finance, health and welfare, and many others.\"\n","During the 1950s and 1960s, Puerto Rico experienced rapid industrialization, due in large part to \"Operaci\u00f3n Manos a la Obra\" (\"Operation Bootstrap\"), an offshoot of FDR's New Deal. It was intended to transform Puerto Rico's economy from agriculture-based to manufacturing-based to provide more jobs. Puerto Rico has become a major tourist destination, as well as a global center for pharmaceutical manufacturing.\n","Section::::History.:Referendums on statehood or independence.\n","Four referendums have been held since the late 20th century to resolve the political status. The 2012 referendum showed a majority (54% of the voters) in favor of a change in status, with full statehood the preferred option of those who wanted a change.\n","Because there were almost 500,000 blank ballots in the 2012 referendum, creating confusion as to the voters' true desire, Congress decided to ignore the vote.\n","The first three plebiscites provided voters with three options: statehood, free association, and independence. The Puerto Rican status referendum, 2017 in June 2017 was going to offer only two options: Statehood and Independence\/Free Association. However, a letter from the Donald Trump administration recommended adding the Commonwealth, the current status, in the plebiscite. The option had been removed from this plebiscite in response to the results of the plebiscite in 2012 which asked whether to remain in the current status and No had won. The Trump administration cited changes in demographics during the past 5 years to add the option once again. Amendments to the plebiscite bill were adopted making ballot wording changes requested by the Department of Justice, as well as adding a \"current territorial status\" option. While 97 percent voted in favor of statehood, the turnout was low; only some 23 percent voted. After the ballots were counted the Justice Department was non-committal. The Justice Department had asked for the 2017 plebiscite to be postponed but the Rossell\u00f3 government chose not to do so. After the outcome was announced, the department told the Associated Press that it had \"not reviewed or approved the ballot's language\".\n","Former governor An\u00edbal Acevedo Vil\u00e1 (2005\u20132009) is convinced that statehood is not the solution for either the U.S. or for Puerto Rico \"for economic, identity and cultural reasons\". He pointed out that voter turnout for the 2017 referendum was extremely low, and suggests that a different type of mutually-beneficial relationship should be found.\n","If the federal government agrees to discuss an association agreement, the conditions would be negotiated between the two entities. The agreement might cover topics such as the role of the U.S. military in Puerto Rico, the use of the U.S. currency, free trade between the two entities, and whether Puerto Ricans would be U.S. citizens.\n","The three current Free Associated States (Marshall Islands, Micronesia and Palau) use the American dollar, receive some financial support and the promise of military defense if they refuse military access to any other country. Their citizens are allowed to work in the U.S. and serve in its military.\n","Governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 is strongly in favor of statehood to help develop the economy and help to \"solve our 500-year-old colonial dilemma ... Colonialism is not an option ... It's a civil rights issue ... 3.5\u00a0million citizens seeking an absolute democracy,\" he told the news media. Benefits of statehood include an additional $10\u00a0billion per year in federal funds, the right to vote in presidential elections, higher Social Security and Medicare benefits, and a right for its government agencies and municipalities to file for bankruptcy. The latter is currently prohibited.\n","Statehood might be useful as a means of dealing with the financial crisis, since it would allow for bankruptcy and the relevant protection. According to the Government Development Bank, this might be the only solution to the debt crisis. Congress has the power to vote to allow Chapter 9 protection without the need for statehood, but in late 2015 there was very little support in the House for this concept. Other benefits to statehood include increased disability benefits and Medicaid funding, the right to vote in presidential elections and the higher (federal) minimum wage.\n","Subsequent to the 2017 referendum, Puerto Rico's legislators are also expected to vote on a bill that would allow the governor to draft a state constitution and hold elections to choose senators and representatives to the federal Congress. In spite of the outcome of the referendum, and the so-called Tennessee Plan (above), action by the United States Congress would be necessary to implement changes to the status of Puerto Rico under the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution.\n","Section::::History.:United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization.\n","Since 1953, the UN has been considering the political status of Puerto Rico and how to assist it in achieving \"independence\" or \"decolonization\". In 1978, the Special Committee determined that a \"colonial relationship\" existed between the U.S. and Puerto Rico.\n","The UN's Special Committee on Decolonization has often referred to Puerto Rico as a \"nation\" in its reports, because, internationally, the people of Puerto Rico are often considered to be a Caribbean nation with their own national identity. Most recently, in a June 2016 report, the Special Committee called for the United States to expedite the process to allow self-determination in Puerto Rico. More specifically, the group called on the United States to expedite a process that would allow the people of Puerto Rico to exercise fully their right to self-determination and independence. ... allow the Puerto Rican people to take decisions in a sovereign manner, and to address their urgent economic and social needs, including unemployment, marginalization, insolvency and poverty\". However, these efforts have been meaningless and without effect for the most part.\n","Section::::History.:United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization.:International status.\n","On November 27, 1953, shortly after the establishment of the Commonwealth, the General Assembly of the United Nations approved Resolution 748, removing Puerto Rico's classification as a non-self-governing territory. The General Assembly did not apply the full list of criteria which was enunciated in 1960 when it took favorable note of the cessation of transmission of information regarding the non-self-governing status of Puerto Rico.\n","According to the White House Task Force on Puerto Rico's Political Status in its December 21, 2007 report, the U.S., in its written submission to the UN in 1953, never represented that Congress could not change its relationship with Puerto Rico without the territory's consent. It stated that the U.S. Justice Department in 1959 reiterated that Congress held power over Puerto Rico pursuant to the Territorial Clause of the U.S. Constitution.\n","In 1993 the United States Court of Appeals for the Eleventh Circuit stated that Congress may unilaterally repeal the Puerto Rican Constitution or the Puerto Rican Federal Relations Act and replace them with any rules or regulations of its choice. In a 1996 report on a Puerto Rico status political bill, the U.S. House Committee on Resources stated, \"Puerto Rico's current status does not meet the criteria for any of the options for full self-government under Resolution 1541\" (the three established forms of full self-government being stated in the report as (1) national independence, (2) free association based on separate sovereignty, or (3) full integration with another nation on the basis of equality). The report concluded that Puerto Rico \"... remains an unincorporated colony and does not have the status of 'free association' with the United States as that status is defined under United States law or international practice\", that the establishment of local self-government with the consent of the people can be unilaterally revoked by the U.S. Congress, and that U.S. Congress can also withdraw the U.S. citizenship of Puerto Rican residents of Puerto Rico at any time, for a legitimate Federal purpose. The application of the U.S. Constitution to Puerto Rico is limited by the Insular Cases.\n","In 2006, 2007, 2009, 2010, and 2011 the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization passed resolutions calling on the United States to expedite a process \"that would allow Puerto Ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence\", and to release all Puerto Rican political prisoners in U.S. prisons, to clean up, decontaminate and return the lands in the islands of Vieques and Culebra to the people of Puerto Rico, to perform a probe into U.S. human rights violations on the island and a probe into the killing by the FBI of pro-independence leader Filiberto Ojeda Rios.\n","Section::::History.:21st century.\n","On July 15, 2009, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization approved a draft resolution calling on the government of the United States to expedite a process that would allow the Puerto Rican people to exercise fully their inalienable right to self-determination and independence.\n","On April 29, 2010, the U.S. House voted 223\u2013169 to approve a measure for a federally sanctioned process for Puerto Rico's self-determination, allowing Puerto Rico to set a new referendum on whether to continue its present form of commonwealth, or to have a different political status. If Puerto Ricans voted to continue as a commonwealth, the government of Puerto Rico was authorized to conduct additional plebiscites at intervals of every eight years from the date on which the results of the prior plebiscite were certified; if Puerto Ricans voted to have a different political status, a second referendum would determine whether Puerto Rico would become a U.S. state, an independent country, or a sovereign nation associated with the U.S. that would not be subject to the Territorial Clause of the United States Constitution. During the House debate, a fourth option, to retain its present form of commonwealth (sometimes referred to as \"the status quo\") political status, was added as an option in the second plebiscite.\n","Immediately following U.S. House passage, H.R. 2499 was sent to the U.S. Senate, where it was given two formal readings and referred to the Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources. On December 22, 2010, the 111th United States Congress adjourned without any Senate vote on H.R.2499, killing the bill.\n","The latest Task Force report was released on March 11, 2011. The report suggested a two-plebiscite process, including a \"first plebiscite that requires the people of Puerto Rico to choose whether they wish to be part of the United States (either via Statehood or Commonwealth) or wish to be independent (via Independence or Free Association). If continuing to be part of the United States were chosen in the first plebiscite, a second vote would be taken between Statehood and Commonwealth.\"\n","On June 14, 2011, President Barack Obama \"promised to support 'a clear decision' by the people of Puerto Rico on statehood\". That same month, the United Nations Special Committee on Decolonization passed a resolution and adopted a consensus text introduced by Cuba's delegate on June 20, 2011, calling on the United States to expedite a process \"that would allow Puerto Ricans to fully exercise their inalienable right to self-determination and independence\".\n","On November 6, 2012, a two-question referendum took place, simultaneous with the general elections. The first question, voted on in August, asked voters whether they wanted to maintain the current status under the territorial clause of the U.S. Constitution. 54% voted against the status quo, effectively approving the second question to be voted on in November. The second question posed three alternate status options: statehood, independence, or free association. 61.16% voted for statehood, 33.34% for a sovereign free associated state, and 5.49% for independence.\n","There were also 515,348 blank and invalidated ballots, which are not reflected in the final tally, as they are not considered cast votes under Puerto Rico law. On December 11, 2012, Puerto Rico's Legislature passed a concurrent resolution to request to the president and the U.S. Congress action on November 6, 2012, plebiscite results. But on April 10, 2013, with the issue still being widely debated, the White House announced that it will seek $2.5\u00a0million to hold another referendum, this next one being the first Puerto Rican status referendum to be financed by the U.S. Federal government.\n","In December 2015, the U.S. government submitted a brief as Amicus Curiae to the U.S. Supreme Court related to the case \"Puerto Rico v. Sanchez Valle\". The U.S. government official position is that the U.S. Constitution does not contemplate \"sovereign territories\". That the Court has consistently recognized that \"there is no sovereignty in a Territory of the United States but that of the United States itself\". and a U.S. territory has \"no independent sovereignty comparable to that of a state. That is because \"the Government of a territory owes its existence wholly to the United States\". Congress's plenary authority over federal territories includes the authority to permit self-government, whereby local officials administer a territory's internal affairs. On June 9, 2016, the court ruled by a 6\u20132 majority that Puerto Rico is a territory and thus lacks sovereignty.\n","On June 30, 2016, the President signed a new law approved by U.S. Congress, H.R. 5278: PROMESA, establishing a Control Board over the Puerto Rico government. This board will have a significant degree of federal control involved in its establishment and operations. In particular, the authority to establish the control board derives from the federal government's constitutional power to \"make all needful rules and regulations\" regarding U.S. territories; The president would appoint all seven voting members of the board; and the board would have broad sovereign powers to effectively overrule decisions by Puerto Rico's legislature, governor, and other public authorities.\n","Section::::History.:Political status.\n","The latest referendum on statehood, independence, or an associated republic was held on November 6, 2012. The people of Puerto Rico made history by requesting, for the first time ever, the conclusion of the island's current territorial status. Almost 78% of registered voters participated in a plebiscite held to resolve Puerto Rico's status, and a slim but clear majority (54%) disagreed with Puerto Rico's maintaining its present territorial status. Furthermore, among the possible alternatives, sixty-one percent (61%) of voters chose the statehood option, while one third of the ballots were submitted blank.\n","On December 11, 2012, the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico enacted a concurrent resolution requesting the president and the Congress of the United States to respond to the referendum of the people of Puerto Rico, held on November 6, 2012, to end its current form of territorial status and to begin the process to admit Puerto Rico as a State. The initiative has not made Puerto Rico into a state.\n","Section::::History.:Hurricanes Irma and Maria.\n","In September 2017, the island was hit by two major hurricanes: Irma and Maria. Hurricane Irma hit the island on September 6 as a category 5 hurricane with maximum sustained winds of , and was the most powerful hurricane to hit the island in recorded history. The heart of the storm stayed off-shore, but the northeast of Puerto Rico, including San Juan, saw catastrophic damage. Nearly half of the island lost power, and the already weak power grid was significantly weakened. This led to a humanitarian crisis, which was further exacerbated by Hurricane Maria's landfall as a Category 4 storm. After the two hurricanes hit, the entire island was without power, and total casualties topped 3,000.\n","The recovery as of late November was slow but progress had been made. Electricity was restored to two-thirds of the island, although there was some doubt as to the number of residents getting reliable power. In January 2018, it was reported that close to 40 percent of the island's customers still did not have electricity.\n","The vast majority had access to water but were still required to boil it. The number still living in shelters had dropped to 982 with thousands of others living with relatives. The official death toll at the time was 58 but some sources indicated that the actual number is much higher. A dam on the island was close to failure and officials were concerned about additional flooding from this source.\n","Thousands had left Puerto Rico, with close to 200,000 having arrived in Florida alone. Those who were then living on the mainland experienced difficulty in getting health care benefits. A \"The New York Times\" report on November 27 said it was understandable that Puerto Ricans wanted to leave the island. \"Basic essentials are hard to find and electricity and other utilities are unreliable or entirely inaccessible. Much of the population has been unable to return to jobs or to school and access to health care has been severely limited.\" The Center for Puerto Rican Studies at New York's Hunter College estimated that some half million people, about 14% of the population, may permanently leave by 2019.\n","The total damage on the island was estimated as up to $95\u00a0billion. By the end of November, FEMA had received over a million applications for aid and had approved about a quarter of those. The US government had agreed in October to provide funding to rebuild and up to $4.9\u00a0billion in loans to help the island's government. FEMA had $464\u00a0million earmarked to help local governments rebuild public buildings and infrastructure. Bills for other funding were being considered in Washington but little progress had been made on those.\n","A November 28, 2017 report by the Sierra Club included this comment: \"It will take years to rebuild Puerto Rico, not just from the worst hurricane to make landfall since 1932, but to sustainably overcome environmental injustices which made Maria's devastation even more catastrophic\".\n","In May 2017, the Natural Resources Defense Council reported that Puerto Rico's water system was the worst as measured by the Clean Water Act. 70% of the population drank water that violated U.S. law.\n","Section::::History.:Hurricanes Irma and Maria.:Rebuilding efforts.\n","A tourism web site report in March 2018 indicated that all airports were operating, although Luis Munoz Marin Airport would not be back to handling the full number of flights until July 2018. Some 90% of the island was receiving electricity, although the power structure would require another $17.6\u00a0billion for full rebuilding, according to the United States Department of Energy.\n","Nearly all residents had access to telecommunications service and running water. All hospitals were operating. Some 83% of hotel rooms were available for use and the cruise ship port was receiving ships; 58 arrived in San Juan in February. The island was encouraging operators to increase the number of tourists.\n","Reports in April 2018 stated that Puerto Rico will receive $18.5\u00a0billion from the United States Department of Housing and Urban Development to help rebuild homes and infrastructure. This was substantially less than the $46\u00a0billion requested by the governor. However, the island was expecting to receive approximately $50\u00a0billion for disaster relief over the subsequent six years mostly via the Federal Emergency Management Agency. At that time, nearly 2800 families were living in FEMA-sponsored short-term housing across 34 states and Puerto Rico. Nearly half of the schools are operating at only 60% classroom capacity. Over 280 public schools would not reopen in the fall; 827 were expected to be operational. Almost 40,000 students left the island's schools since May 2017; some of these were in schools in the mainland U.S. (Before the hurricanes, Puerto Rico had planned to close 179 schools due to inadequate numbers of students.)\n","Section::::History.:Hurricanes Irma and Maria.:Death toll.\n","The official number of Hurricane Maria-related deaths as reported by the government of Puerto Rico was 64. The Commonwealth commissioned George Washington University to assess the death toll. An academic study based on household surveys and reported in the New England Journal of Medicine\u00a0estimated that the number of hurricane-related deaths during the period September 20, 2017 to December 31, 2017 was around 4,600 (range 793\u20138,498) On August 28, Governor Rossell\u00f3 acknowledged the results of the George Washington University study and revised the island's official death toll to 2,975\u00a0people. Rossell\u00f3 described the effects of the hurricane as \"unprecedented devastation\".\n","Section::::Geography.\n","Puerto Rico consists of the main island of Puerto Rico and various smaller islands, including Vieques, Culebra, Mona, Desecheo, and Caja de Muertos. Of these five, only Culebra and Vieques are inhabited year-round. Mona, which has played a key role in maritime history, is uninhabited most of the year except for employees of the Puerto Rico Department of Natural Resources. There are many other even smaller islets, like Monito, which is near to Mona, Isla de Cabras and La Isleta de San Juan, both located on the San Juan Bay. The latter is the only inhabited islet with communities like Old San Juan and Puerta de Tierra, and connected to the main island by bridges.\n","The Commonwealth of Puerto Rico has an area of , of which is land and is water. Puerto Rico is larger than Delaware and Rhode Island. The maximum length of the main island from east to west is , and the maximum width from north to south is . Puerto Rico is the smallest of the Greater Antilles. It is 80% of the size of Jamaica, just over 18% of the size of Hispaniola and 8% of the size of Cuba, the largest of the Greater Antilles.\n","The island is mostly mountainous with large coastal areas in the north and south. The main mountain range is called \"La Cordillera Central\" (The Central Range). The highest elevation in Puerto Rico, Cerro de Punta , is located in this range.\n","Another important peak is El Yunque, one of the highest in the \"Sierra de Luquillo\" at the El Yunque National Forest, with an elevation of .\n","Puerto Rico has 17 lakes, all man-made, and more than 50 rivers, most originating in the Cordillera Central. Rivers in the northern region of the island are typically longer and of higher water flow rates than those of the south, since the south receives less rain than the central and northern regions.\n","Puerto Rico is composed of Cretaceous to Eocene volcanic and plutonic rocks, overlain by younger Oligocene and more recent carbonates and other sedimentary rocks. Most of the caverns and karst topography on the island occurs in the northern region in the carbonates. The oldest rocks are approximately years old (Jurassic) and are located at Sierra Bermeja in the southwest part of the island. They may represent part of the oceanic crust and are believed to come from the Pacific Ocean realm.\n","Puerto Rico lies at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates and is being deformed by the tectonic stresses caused by their interaction. These stresses may cause earthquakes and tsunamis. These seismic events, along with landslides, represent some of the most dangerous geologic hazards in the island and in the northeastern Caribbean.\n","The most recent major earthquake occurred on , 1918, and had an estimated magnitude of 7.5 on the Richter scale. It originated off the coast of Aguadilla, several kilometers off the northern coast, and was accompanied by a tsunami. It caused extensive property damage and widespread losses, damaging infrastructure, especially bridges. It resulted in an estimated 116 deaths and $4\u00a0million in property damage. The failure of the government to move rapidly to provide for the general welfare contributed to political activism by opponents and eventually to the rise of the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party.\n","The Puerto Rico Trench, the largest and deepest trench in the Atlantic, is located about north of Puerto Rico at the boundary between the Caribbean and North American plates. It is long. At its deepest point, named the Milwaukee Deep, it is almost deep.\n","Section::::Geography.:Climate.\n","The climate of Puerto Rico in the K\u00f6ppen climate classification is tropical rainforest. Temperatures are warm to hot year round, averaging near 85\u00a0\u00b0F (29\u00a0\u00b0C) in lower elevations and 70\u00a0\u00b0F (21\u00a0\u00b0C) in the mountains. Easterly trade winds pass across the island year round. Puerto Rico has a rainy season which stretches from April into November. The mountains of the Cordillera Central are the main cause of the variations in the temperature and rainfall that occur over very short distances. The mountains can also cause wide variation in local wind speed and direction due to their sheltering and channeling effects adding to the climatic variation.\n","The island has an average temperature of throughout the year, with an average minimum temperature of and maximum of . Daily temperature changes seasonally are quite small in the lowlands and coastal areas. The temperature in the south is usually a few degrees higher than those in the north and temperatures in the central interior mountains are always cooler than those on the rest of the island.\n","Between the dry and wet season, there is a temperature change of around . This change is due mainly to the warm waters of the tropical Atlantic Ocean, which significantly modify cooler air moving in from the north and northwest. Coastal waters temperatures around the years are about in February to in August. The highest temperature ever recorded was at Arecibo, while the lowest temperature ever recorded was in the mountains at Adjuntas, Aibonito, and Corozal. The average yearly precipitation is .\n","Puerto Rico experiences the Atlantic hurricane season, similar to the remainder of the Caribbean Sea and North Atlantic oceans. On average, a quarter of its annual rainfall is contributed from tropical cyclones, which are more prevalent during periods of La Ni\u00f1a than El Ni\u00f1o. A cyclone of tropical storm strength passes near Puerto Rico, on average, every five years. A hurricane passes in the vicinity of the island, on average, every seven years. Since 1851, the Lake Okeechobee Hurricane (also known as the San Felipe Segundo hurricane in Puerto Rico) of September 1928 is the only hurricane to make landfall as a Category 5 hurricane.\n","In the busy 2017 Atlantic hurricane season, Puerto Rico avoided a direct hit by the Category 5 Hurricane Irma on September 6, 2017, as it passed about north of Puerto Rico, but high winds caused a loss of electrical power to some one million residents. Almost 50% of hospitals were operating with power provided by generators. The Category 4 Hurricane Jose, as expected, veered away from Puerto Rico. A short time later, the devastating Hurricane Maria made landfall on Puerto Rico on Wednesday, September 20, near the Yabucoa municipality at 10:15\u00a0UTC (6:15\u00a0am local time) as a high-end Category\u00a04 hurricane with sustained winds of 155\u00a0mph (250\u00a0km\/h), powerful rains and widespread flooding causing tremendous destruction, including the electrical grid, which would remain out for 4\u20136 months in many portions of the island.\n","Section::::Geography.:Biodiversity.\n","Species endemic to the archipelago number 239 plants, 16 birds and 39 amphibians\/reptiles, recognized as of 1998. Most of these (234, 12 and 33 respectively) are found on the main island. The most recognizable endemic species and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the \"coqu\u00ed\", a small frog easily identified by the sound of its call, from which it gets its name. Most \"coqu\u00ed\" species (13 of 17) live in the El Yunque National Forest, a tropical rainforest in the northeast of the island previously known as the Caribbean National Forest. El Yunque is home to more than 240 plants, 26 of which are endemic to the island. It is also home to 50 bird species, including the critically endangered Puerto Rican amazon.\n","Across the island in the southwest, the of dry land at the Gu\u00e1nica Commonwealth Forest Reserve contain over 600 uncommon species of plants and animals, including 48 endangered species and 16 endemic to Puerto Rico.\n","Section::::Demographics.\n","The population of Puerto Rico has been shaped by Amerindian settlement, European colonization, slavery, economic migration, and Puerto Rico's status as unincorporated territory of the United States.\n","Section::::Demographics.:Population makeup.\n","The estimated population of Puerto Rico as of July 1, 2018, was 3,195,153 a 14.24% decrease since the 2010 United States Census. From 2000 to 2010, the population decreased, the first such decrease in census history for Puerto Rico. It went from the 3,808,610 residents registered in the 2000 Census to 3,725,789 in the 2010 Census.\n","A declining and aging population presents additional problems for the society. The U.S. Census Bureau's estimate for July 1, 2018, was 3,195,153 people, down substantially from the 2010 data which had indicated 3,725,789 people.\n","Continuous European immigration and high natural increase helped the population of Puerto Rico grow from 155,426 in 1800, to almost a million by the close of the 19th century.\n","A census conducted by royal decree on September 30, 1858, gave the following totals of the Puerto Rican population at that time: 341,015 were Free colored; 300,430 identified as Whites; and 41,736 were slaves.\n","During the 19th century hundreds of families arrived in Puerto Rico, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia, but also from other parts of Spain such as Catalonia, Asturias, Galicia and the Balearic Islands and numerous Spanish loyalists from Spain's former colonies in South America. Settlers from outside Spain also arrived in the islands, including from Corsica, France, Lebanon, China, Portugal, Ireland, Scotland, Germany and Italy. This immigration from non-Hispanic countries was the result of the \"Real Cedula de Gracias de 1815\" (\"Royal Decree of Graces of 1815\"), which allowed European Catholics to settle in the island with land allotments in the interior of the island, provided they paid taxes and continued to support the Catholic Church.\n","Between 1960 and 1990 the census questionnaire in Puerto Rico did not ask about race or ethnicity. The 2000 United States Census included a racial self-identification question in Puerto Rico. According to the census, most Puerto Ricans identified as White and Hispanic; few identified as Black or some other race.\n","Section::::Demographics.:Population makeup.:Population genetics.\n","A recent population genetics study conducted in Puerto Rico suggests that between 52.6% and 84% of the population possess some degree of Amerindian mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) in their maternal ancestry, usually in a combination with other ancestries such as aboriginal Guanche North-West African ancestry brought by Spanish settlers from the Canary Islands.\n","In addition, these DNA studies show Amerindian ancestry in addition to the Ta\u00edno.\n","One genetic study on the racial makeup of Puerto Ricans (including all races) found them to be roughly around 61% West Eurasian\/North African (overwhelmingly of Spanish provenance), 27% Sub-Saharan African and 11% Native American. Another genetic study from 2007, claimed that \"the average genomewide individual (ie. Puerto Rican) ancestry proportions have been estimated as 66%, 18%, and 16%, for European, West African, and Native American, respectively.\" Another study estimates 63.7% European, 21.2% (Sub-Saharan) African, and 15.2% Native American; European ancestry is more prevalent in the West and in Central Puerto Rico, African in Eastern Puerto Rico, and Native American in Northern Puerto Rico.\n","A Pew Research survey indicated a literacy rate of 90.4% (adult population) in 2012 based on data from the United Nations and a life expectancy of 79.3 years.\n","Section::::Demographics.:Immigration and emigration.\n","Puerto Rico has recently become the permanent home of over 100,000 legal residents. The vast majority of recent immigrants, both legal and illegal, come from the Dominican Republic and Haiti. Other sources sending in significant numbers of recent immigrants include Cuba, Mexico, Colombia, Panama, Jamaica, Venezuela, Spain, and Nigeria. Also, there are many non-Puerto Rican U.S. citizens settling in Puerto Rico, from the mainland United States and the U.S. Virgin Islands, as well as Nuyoricans (stateside Puerto Ricans) coming back to Puerto Rico. Most recent immigrants settle in and around San Juan.\n","Emigration is a major part of contemporary Puerto Rican history. Starting soon after World War\u00a0II, poverty, cheap airfares, and promotion by the island government caused waves of Puerto Ricans to move to the United States, particularly to the Northeastern states, and Florida. This trend continued even as Puerto Rico's economy improved and its birth rate declined. Puerto Ricans continue to follow a pattern of \"circular migration\", with some migrants returning to the island. In recent years, the population has declined markedly, falling nearly 1% in 2012 and an additional 1% (36,000 people) in 2013 due to a falling birthrate and emigration.\n","According to the 2010 Census, the number of Puerto Ricans living in the United States outside of Puerto Rico far exceeds those living in Puerto Rico. Emigration exceeds immigration. As those who leave tend to be better educated than those who remain, this accentuates the drain on Puerto Rico's economy.\n","Based on the July 1, 2018 estimate by the U.S. Census Bureau, the population of the Commonwealth had declined by 530,636 people since the 2010 Census data had been tabulated.\n","Section::::Demographics.:Population distribution.\n","The most populous city is the capital, San Juan, with approximately 371,400 people based on a 2015 estimate by the Census Bureau. Other major cities include Bayam\u00f3n, Carolina, Ponce, and Caguas. Of the ten most populous cities on the island, eight are located within what is considered San Juan's metropolitan area, while the other two are located in the south (Ponce) and west (Mayag\u00fcez) of the island.\n","Section::::Demographics.:Languages.\n","The official languages of the executive branch of government of Puerto Rico are Spanish and English, with Spanish being the primary language. Spanish is, and has been, the only official language of the entire Commonwealth judiciary system, despite a 1902 English-only language law. However, all official business of the U.S. District Court for the District of Puerto Rico is conducted in English. English is the primary language of less than 10% of the population. Spanish is the dominant language of business, education and daily life on the island, spoken by nearly 95% of the population.\n","The U.S. Census Bureau's 2016 update provides the following facts: 94.3% of adults speak only Spanish at home, which compares to 5.5% who speak English, 0.2% who speak French, and 0.1% who speak another language at home.\n","In Puerto Rico, public school instruction is conducted almost entirely in Spanish. There have been pilot programs in about a dozen of the over 1,400 public schools aimed at conducting instruction in English only. Objections from teaching staff are common, perhaps because many of them are not fully fluent in English. English is taught as a second language and is a compulsory subject from elementary levels to high school. The languages of the deaf community are American Sign Language and its local variant, Puerto Rican Sign Language.\n","The Spanish of Puerto Rico has evolved into having many idiosyncrasies in vocabulary and syntax that differentiate it from the Spanish spoken elsewhere. As a product of Puerto Rican history, the island possesses a unique Spanish dialect. Puerto Rican Spanish utilizes many Ta\u00edno words, as well as English words. The largest influence on the Spanish spoken in Puerto Rico is that of the Canary Islands. Ta\u00edno loanwords are most often used in the context of vegetation, natural phenomena, and native musical instruments. Similarly, words attributed to primarily West African languages were adopted in the contexts of foods, music, and dances, particularly in coastal towns with concentrations of descendants of Sub-Saharan Africans.\n","Section::::Demographics.:Religion.\n","The Roman Catholic Church was brought by Spanish colonists and gradually became the dominant religion in Puerto Rico. The first dioceses in the Americas, including that of Puerto Rico, were authorized by Pope Julius\u00a0II in 1511. One Pope, John Paul\u00a0II, visited Puerto Rico in October 1984. All municipalities in Puerto Rico have at least one Catholic church, most of which are located at the town center, or plaza. African slaves brought and maintained various ethnic African religious practices associated with different peoples; in particular, the Yoruba beliefs of Santer\u00eda and\/or If\u00e1, and the Kongo-derived Palo Mayombe. Some aspects were absorbed into syncretic Christianity.\n","Protestantism, which was suppressed under the Spanish Catholic regime, has slightly reemerged under United States rule, making contemporary Puerto Rico more interconfessional than in previous centuries, although Catholicism continues to be the dominant religion. The first Protestant church, Iglesia de la Sant\u00edsima Trinidad, was established in Ponce by the Anglican Diocese of Antigua in 1872. It was the first non-Roman Catholic Church in the entire Spanish Empire in the Americas.\n","Pollster Pablo Ramos stated in 1998 that the population was 38% Roman Catholic, 28% Pentecostal, and 18% were members of independent churches, which would give a Protestant percentage of 46% if the last two populations are combined. Protestants collectively added up to almost two million people. Another researcher gave a more conservative assessment of the proportion of Protestants:\n","Puerto Rico, by virtue of its long political association with the United States, is the most Protestant of Latin American countries, with a Protestant population of approximately 33 to 38 percent, the majority of whom are Pentecostal. David Stoll calculates that if we extrapolate the growth rates of evangelical churches from 1960 to 1985 for another twenty-five years Puerto Rico will become 75 percent evangelical. (Ana Adams: \"Brincando el Charco...\" in \"Power, Politics and Pentecostals in Latin America\", Edward Cleary, ed., 1997. p.\u00a0164).\n","An Associated Press article in March 2014 stated that \"more than 70 percent of whom identify themselves as Catholic\" but provided no source for this information.\n","The CIA World Factbook reports that 85% of the population of Puerto Rico identifies as Roman Catholic, while 15% identify as Protestant and Other. Neither a date or a source for that information is provided and may not be recent. A 2013 Pew Research survey found that only about 45% of Puerto Rican adults identified themselves as Catholic, 29% as Protestant and 20% as unaffiliated with a religion. The people surveyed by Pew consisted of Puerto Ricans living in the 50 states and DC and may not be indicative of those living in the Commonwealth.\n","By 2014, a Pew Research report, with the sub-title \"Widespread Change in a Historically Catholic Region\", indicated that only 56% of Puerto Ricans were Catholic and that 33% were Protestant; this survey was completed between October 2013 and February 2014.\n","An Eastern Orthodox community, the Dormition of the Most Holy Theotokos \/ St. Spyridon's Church is located in Trujillo Alto, and serves the small Orthodox community. This affiliation accounted for under 1% of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research report. In 1940, Juanita Garc\u00eda Peraza founded the Mita Congregation, the first religion of Puerto Rican origin. Ta\u00edno religious practices have been rediscovered\/reinvented to a degree by a handful of advocates. Similarly, some aspects of African religious traditions have been kept by some adherents. In 1952, a handful of American Jews established the island's first synagogue; this religion accounts for under 1% of the population in 2010 according to the Pew Research report. The synagogue, called \"Sha'are Zedeck\", hired its first rabbi in 1954. Puerto Rico has the largest Jewish community in the Caribbean, numbering 3000 people (date not stated), and is the only Caribbean island in which the Conservative, Reform and Orthodox Jewish movements all are represented. In 2007, there were about 5,000 Muslims in Puerto Rico, representing about 0.13% of the population. Eight mosques are located throughout the island, with most Muslims living in R\u00edo Piedras and Caguas, most of these Muslims are of Palestinian and Jordanian descent. There is also a Bah\u00e1'\u00ed community on the island.\n","In 2015, the 25,832 Jehovah's Witnesses represented about 0.70% of the population, with 324 congregations. The Padmasambhava Buddhist Center, whose followers practice Tibetan Buddhism, as well as Nichiren Buddhism have branches in Puerto Rico. There are several atheist activist and educational organizations, and an atheistic parody religion called the Pastafarian Church of Puerto Rico. There is also an ISKCON temple in Gurabo devoted to Krishna Consciousness, as well as two preaching centers in the metropolitan area.\n","Section::::Government.\n","Puerto Rico has 8 senatorial districts, 40 representative districts and 78 municipalities. It has a republican form of government with separation of powers subject to the jurisdiction and sovereignty of the United States. Its current powers are all delegated by the United States Congress and lack full protection under the United States Constitution. Puerto Rico's head of state is the president of the United States.\n","The government of Puerto Rico, based on the formal republican system, is composed of three branches: the executive, legislative, and judicial branch. The executive branch is headed by the governor, currently Ricky Rossell\u00f3. The legislative branch consists of a bicameral legislature called the Legislative Assembly, made up of a Senate as its upper chamber and a House of Representatives as its lower chamber. The Senate is headed by the president of the Senate, currently Thomas Rivera Schatz, while the House of Representatives is headed by the speaker of the House, currently Johnny M\u00e9ndez. The governor and legislators are elected by popular vote every four years with the last election held in November 2016.\n","The judicial branch is headed by the chief justice of the Supreme Court of Puerto Rico, currently Maite Oronoz Rodr\u00edguez. Members of the judicial branch are appointed by the governor with the advice and consent of the Senate.\n","Puerto Rico is represented in the United States Congress by a nonvoting delegate, the Resident Commissioner, currently Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez. Current congressional rules have removed the Commissioner's power to vote in the Committee of the Whole, but the Commissioner can vote in committee.\n","Puerto Rican elections are governed by the Federal Election Commission and the State Elections Commission of Puerto Rico. While residing in Puerto Rico, Puerto Ricans cannot vote in U.S. presidential elections, but they can vote in primaries. Puerto Ricans who become residents of a U.S. state can vote in presidential elections.\n","Puerto Rico hosts consulates from 41 countries, mainly from the Americas and Europe, with most located in San Juan. As an unincorporated territory of the United States, Puerto Rico does not have any first-order administrative divisions as defined by the U.S. government, but has 78 municipalities at the second level. Mona Island is not a municipality, but part of the municipality of Mayag\u00fcez.\n","Municipalities are subdivided into wards or barrios, and those into sectors. Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected for a four-year term. The municipality of San Juan (previously called \"town\"), was founded first, in 1521, San Germ\u00e1n in 1570, Coamo in 1579, Arecibo in 1614, Aguada in 1692 and Ponce in 1692. An increase of settlement saw the founding of 30 municipalities in the 18th century and 34 in the 19th. Six were founded in the 20th century; the last was Florida in 1971.\n","Section::::Government.:Political parties and elections.\n","Since 1952, Puerto Rico has had three main political parties: the Popular Democratic Party (PPD in Spanish), the New Progressive Party (PNP in Spanish) and the Puerto Rican Independence Party (PIP). The three parties stand for different political status. The PPD, for example, seeks to maintain the island's status with the U.S. as a commonwealth, while the PNP, on the other hand, seeks to make Puerto Rico a state of the United States. The PIP, in contrast, seeks a complete separation from the United States by seeking to make Puerto Rico a sovereign nation. In terms of party strength, the PPD and PNP usually hold about 47% of the vote each while the PIP holds only about 5%.\n","After 2007, other parties emerged on the island. The first, the Puerto Ricans for Puerto Rico Party (PPR in Spanish) was registered that same year. The party claims that it seeks to address the islands' problems from a status-neutral platform. But it ceased to remain as a registered party when it failed to obtain the required number of votes in the 2008 general election. Four years later, the 2012 election saw the emergence of the Movimiento Uni\u00f3n Soberanista (MUS; English: \"Sovereign Union Movement\") and the Partido del Pueblo Trabajador (PPT; English: \"Working People's Party\") but none obtained more than 1% of the vote.\n","Other non-registered parties include the Puerto Rican Nationalist Party, the Socialist Workers Movement, and the Hostosian National Independence Movement.\n","Section::::Government.:Law.\n","The insular legal system is a blend of civil law and the common law systems.\n","Puerto Rico is the only current U.S. possession whose legal system operates primarily in a language other than American English: namely, Spanish. Because the U.S. federal government operates primarily in English, all Puerto Rican attorneys must be bilingual in order to litigate in English in U.S. federal courts, and litigate federal preemption issues in Puerto Rican courts.\n","Title 48 of the United States Code outlines the role of the United States Code to United States territories and insular areas such as Puerto Rico. After the U.S. government assumed control of Puerto Rico in 1901, it initiated legal reforms resulting in the adoption of codes of criminal law, criminal procedure, and civil procedure modeled after those then in effect in California. Although Puerto Rico has since followed the federal example of transferring criminal and civil procedure from statutory law to rules promulgated by the judiciary, several portions of its criminal law still reflect the influence of the California Penal Code.\n","The judicial branch is headed by the Chief Justice of the Puerto Rico Supreme Court, which is the only appellate court required by the Constitution. All other courts are created by the Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico. There is also a Federal District Court for Puerto Rico. Someone accused of a criminal act at the federal level may not be accused for the same act in a Commonwealth court, unlike a state court, since Puerto Rico as a territory lacks sovereignty separate from Congress as a state does. Such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy.\n","Section::::Government.:Political status.\n","The nature of Puerto Rico's political relationship with the U.S. is the subject of ongoing debate in Puerto Rico, the United States Congress, and the United Nations. Specifically, the basic question is whether Puerto Rico should remain a U.S. territory, become a U.S. state, or become an independent country.\n","Section::::Government.:Political status.:Within the United States.\n","Constitutionally, Puerto Rico is subject to the plenary powers of the United States Congress under the territorial clause of Article IV of the U.S. Constitution. Laws enacted at the federal level in the United States apply to Puerto Rico as well, regardless of its political status. Their residents do not have voting representation in the U.S. Congress. Like the different states of the United States, Puerto Rico lacks \"the full sovereignty of an independent nation\", for example, the power to manage its \"external relations with other nations\", which is held by the U.S. federal government. The Supreme Court of the United States has indicated that once the U.S. Constitution has been extended to an area (by Congress or the courts), its coverage is irrevocable. To hold that the political branches may switch the Constitution on or off at will would lead to a regime in which they, not this Court, say \"what the law is\".\n","Puerto Ricans \"were collectively made U.S. citizens\" in 1917 as a result of the Jones-Shafroth Act. U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico cannot vote for the U.S. president, though both major parties, Republican and Democratic, run primary elections in Puerto Rico to send delegates to vote on a presidential candidate. Since Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory (see above) and not a U.S. state, the United States Constitution does not fully enfranchise U.S. citizens residing in Puerto Rico.\n","Only fundamental rights under the American federal constitution and adjudications are applied to Puerto Ricans. Various other U.S. Supreme Court decisions have held which rights apply in Puerto Rico and which ones do not. Puerto Ricans have a long history of service in the U.S. Armed Forces and, since 1917, they have been included in the U.S. compulsory draft whensoever it has been in effect.\n","Though the Commonwealth government has its own tax laws, Puerto Ricans are also required to pay many kinds of U.S. federal taxes, not including the federal personal income tax for Puerto Rico-sourced income, but only under certain circumstances. In 2009, Puerto Rico paid into the U.S. Treasury. Residents of Puerto Rico pay into Social Security, and are thus eligible for Social Security benefits upon retirement. They are excluded from the Supplemental Security Income (SSI), and the island actually receives a smaller fraction of the Medicaid funding it would receive if it were a U.S. state. Also, Medicare providers receive less-than-full state-like reimbursements for services rendered to beneficiaries in Puerto Rico, even though the latter paid fully into the system.\n","While a state may try an individual for the same crime he\/she was tried in federal court, this is not the case in Puerto Rico. Being a U.S. territory, Puerto Rico's authority to enact a criminal code derives from Congress and not from local sovereignty as with the states. Thus, such a parallel accusation would constitute double jeopardy and is constitutionally impermissible.\n","In 1992, President George H. W. Bush issued a memorandum to heads of executive departments and agencies establishing the current administrative relationship between the federal government and the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. This memorandum directs all federal departments, agencies, and officials to treat Puerto Rico administratively as if it were a state, insofar as doing so would not disrupt federal programs or operations.\n","Many federal executive branch agencies have significant presence in Puerto Rico, just as in any state, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Federal Emergency Management Agency, Transportation Security Administration, Social Security Administration, and others. While Puerto Rico has its own Commonwealth judicial system similar to that of a U.S. state, there is also a U.S. federal district court in Puerto Rico, and Puerto Ricans have served as judges in that Court and in other federal courts on the U.S. mainland regardless of their residency status at the time of their appointment. Sonia Sotomayor, a New Yorker of Puerto Rican descent, serves as an associate justice of the Supreme Court of the United States. Puerto Ricans have also been frequently appointed to high-level federal positions, including serving as United States Ambassadors to other nations.\n","Section::::Government.:Foreign and intergovernmental relations.\n","Puerto Rico is subject to the Commerce and Territorial Clause of the Constitution of the United States and, therefore, is restricted on how it can engage with other nations, sharing the opportunities and limitations that state governments have albeit not being one. As is the case with state governments, regardless, it has established several trade agreements with other nations, particularly with Hispanic American countries such as Colombia and Panam\u00e1.\n","It has also established trade promotion offices in many foreign countries, all Spanish-speaking, and within the United States itself, which now include Spain, the Dominican Republic, Panama, Colombia, Washington, D.C., New York City and Florida, and has included in the past offices in Chile, Costa Rica, and Mexico. Such agreements require permission from the U.S. Department of State; most are simply allowed by existing laws or trade treaties between the United States and other nations which supersede trade agreements pursued by Puerto Rico and different U.S. states.\n","At the local level, Puerto Rico established by law that the international relations which states and territories are allowed to engage must be handled by the Department of State of Puerto Rico, an executive department, headed by the Secretary of State of Puerto Rico, who also serves as the territory's lieutenant governor. It is also charged to liaise with general consuls and honorary consuls based in Puerto Rico. The Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration, along with the Office of the Resident Commissioner, manages all its intergovernmental affairs before entities of or in the United States (including the federal government of the United States, local and state governments of the United States, and public or private entities in the United States).\n","Both entities frequently assist the Department of State of Puerto Rico in engaging with Washington, D.C.-based ambassadors and federal agencies that handle Puerto Rico's foreign affairs, such as the U.S. Department of State, the Agency for International Development, and others. The current Secretary of State is V\u00edctor Su\u00e1rez Mel\u00e9ndez from the Popular Democratic Party and member of the Democratic Party of the United States, while the current Director of the Puerto Rico Federal Affairs Administration is Juan Eugenio Hern\u00e1ndez Mayoral also from the Popular Democratic and member of the Democratic Party.\n","The Resident Commissioner of Puerto Rico, the delegate elected by Puerto Ricans to represent them before the federal government, including the U.S. Congress, sits in the United States House of Representatives, serves and votes on congressional committees, and functions in every respect as a legislator except being denied a vote on the final disposition of legislation on the House floor, also engages in foreign affairs to the same extent as other members of Congress. The current Resident Commissioner is Jenniffer Gonz\u00e1lez-Col\u00f3n, a Republican, elected in 2016. She received more votes than any other official elected in Puerto Rico that year.\n","Many Puerto Ricans have served as United States ambassadors to different nations and international organizations, such as the Organization of American States, mostly but not exclusively in Latin America. For example, Maricarmen Aponte, a Puerto Rican and now an Acting Assistant Secretary of State, previously served as U.S. ambassador to El Salvador.\n","Section::::Government.:Military.\n","As it is a territory of the United States of America, the defense of Puerto Rico is provided by the United States as part of the Treaty of Paris with the president of the United States as its commander-in-chief. Puerto Rico has its own Puerto Rico National Guard, and its own state defense force, the Puerto Rico State Guard, which by local law is under the authority of the Puerto Rico National Guard.\n","The commander-in-chief of both local forces is the governor of Puerto Rico who delegates his authority to the Puerto Rico Adjutant General, currently Brigadier General Isabelo Rivera. The Adjutant General, in turn, delegates the authority over the State Guard to another officer but retains the authority over the Puerto Rico National Guard as a whole.\n","U.S. military installations in Puerto Rico were part of the U.S. Atlantic Command (LANTCOM after 1993 USACOM), which had authority over all U.S. military operations that took place throughout the Atlantic. Puerto Rico had been seen as crucial in supporting LANTCOM's mission until 1999, when U.S. Atlantic Command was renamed and given a new mission as United States Joint Forces Command. Puerto Rico is currently under the responsibility of United States Northern Command.\n","Both the Naval Forces Caribbean (NFC) and the Fleet Air Caribbean (FAIR) were formerly based at the Roosevelt Roads Naval Station. The NFC had authority over all U.S. Naval activity in the waters of the Caribbean while FAIR had authority over all U.S. military flights and air operations over the Caribbean. With the closing of the Roosevelt Roads and Vieques Island training facilities, the U.S. Navy has basically exited from Puerto Rico, except for the ships that steam by, and the only significant military presence in the island is the U.S. Army at Ft Buchanan, the Puerto Rican Army and Air National Guards, and the U.S. Coast Guard. Protests over the noise of bombing practice forced the closure of the naval base. This resulted in a loss of 6,000 jobs and an annual decrease in local income of $300\u00a0million.\n","A branch of the U.S. Army National Guard is stationed in Puerto Rico \u2013 known as the Puerto Rico Army National Guard \u2013 which performs missions equivalent to those of the Army National Guards of the different states of the United States, including ground defense, disaster relief, and control of civil unrest. The local National Guard also incorporates a branch of the U.S. Air National Guard \u2013 known as the Puerto Rico Air National Guard \u2013 which performs missions equivalent to those of the Air National Guards of each one of the U.S. states.\n","At different times in the 20th century, the U.S. had about 25 military or naval installations in Puerto Rico, some very small ones, as well as large installations. The largest of these installations were the former Roosevelt Roads Naval Station in Ceiba, the Atlantic Fleet Weapons Training Facility (AFWTF) on Vieques, the National Guard training facility at Camp Santiago in Salinas, Fort Allen in Juana Diaz, the Army's Fort Buchanan in San Juan, the former U.S. Air Force Ramey Air Force Base in Aguadilla, and the Puerto Rico Air National Guard at Mu\u00f1iz Air Force base in San Juan.\n","The former U.S. Navy facilities at Roosevelt Roads, Vieques, and Sabana Seca have been deactivated and partially turned over to the local government. Other than U.S. Coast Guard and Puerto Rico National Guard facilities, there are only two remaining military installations in Puerto Rico: the U.S. Army's small Ft. Buchanan (supporting local veterans and reserve units) and the PRANG (Puerto Rico Air National Guard) Mu\u00f1iz Air Base (the C-130 Fleet). In recent years, the U.S. Congress has considered their deactivations, but these have been opposed by diverse public and private entities in Puerto Rico \u2013 such as retired military who rely on Ft. Buchanan for the services available there.\n","Puerto Ricans have participated in many of the military conflicts in which the United States has been involved. For example, they participated in the American Revolution, when volunteers from Puerto Rico, Cuba, and Mexico fought the British in 1779 under the command of General Bernardo de G\u00e1lvez (1746\u20131786), and have continued to participate up to the present-day conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan.\n","A significant number of Puerto Ricans participate as members and work for the U.S. Armed Services, largely as National Guard members and civilian employees. The size of the overall military-related community in Puerto Rico is estimated to be 100,000 individuals. This includes retired personnel. Fort Buchanan has about 4,000 military and civilian personnel. In addition, approximately 17,000 people are members of the Puerto Rico Army and Air National Guards, or the U.S. Reserve forces. Puerto Rican soldiers have served in every U.S. military conflict from World War I to the current military engagement known by the United States and its allies as the War against Terrorism.\n","The 65th Infantry Regiment, nicknamed \"\"The Borinqueneers\"\" from the original Ta\u00edno name of the island (Borinquen), is a Puerto Rican regiment of the United States Army. The regiment's motto is \"Honor et Fidelitas\", Latin for \"Honor and Fidelity\". The 65th Infantry Regiment participated in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, and the War on Terror and in 2014 was awarded the Congressional Gold Medal, presented by President Barack Obama, for its heroism during the Korean War.\n","Section::::Government.:Administrative divisions.\n","There are no counties, as there are in 48 of the 50 United States. There are 78 municipalities. Municipalities are subdivided into \"barrios\", and those into sectors. Each municipality has a mayor and a municipal legislature elected to four-year terms.\n","Section::::Economy.\n","The economy of Puerto Rico is classified as a high income economy by the World Bank and as the most competitive economy in Latin America by the World Economic Forum, but Puerto Rico currently has a public debt of $72.204\u00a0billion (equivalent to 103% of GNP), and a government deficit of $2.5\u00a0billion. According to World Bank, gross national income per capita of Puerto Rico in 2013 is $23,830 (PPP, International Dollars), ranked as 63rd among all sovereign and dependent territories entities in the world. Its economy is mainly driven by manufacturing (primarily pharmaceuticals, textiles, petrochemicals and electronics) followed by the service industry (primarily finance, insurance, real estate and tourism). In recent years, the territory has also become a popular destination for MICE (meetings, incentives, conferencing, exhibitions), with a modern convention centre district overlooking the Port of San Juan.\n","The geography of Puerto Rico and its political status are both determining factors on its economic prosperity, primarily due to its relatively small size as an island; its lack of natural resources used to produce raw materials, and, consequently, its dependence on imports; as well as its territorial status with the United States, which controls its foreign policy while exerting trading restrictions, particularly in its shipping industry.\n","Puerto Rico experienced a recession from 2006 to 2011, interrupted by 4 quarters of economic growth, and entered into recession again in 2013, following growing fiscal imbalance and the expiration of the IRS Section 936 corporate incentives that the U.S. Internal Revenue Code had applied to Puerto Rico. This IRS section was critical to the economy, as it established tax exemptions for U.S. corporations that settled in Puerto Rico, and allowed their insular subsidiaries to send their earnings to the parent corporation at any time, without paying federal tax on corporate income. Puerto Rico has surprisingly been able to maintain a relatively low inflation in the past decade while maintaining a purchasing power parity per capita higher than 80% of the rest of the world.\n","Academically, most of Puerto Rico's economic woes stem from federal regulations that expired, have been repealed, or no longer apply to Puerto Rico; its inability to become self-sufficient and self-sustainable throughout history; its highly politicized public policy which tends to change whenever a political party gains power; as well as its highly inefficient local government which has accrued a public debt equal to 68% of its gross domestic product throughout time.\n","In comparison to the different states of the United States, Puerto Rico is poorer than Mississippi (the poorest state of the U.S.) with 41% of its population below the poverty line. When compared to Latin America, Puerto Rico has the highest GDP per capita in the region. Its main trading partners are the United States itself, Ireland, and Japan, with most products coming from East Asia, mainly from China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan. At a global scale, Puerto Rico's dependency on oil for transportation and electricity generation, as well as its dependency on food imports and raw materials, makes Puerto Rico volatile and highly reactive to changes in the world economy and climate. Puerto Rico's agricultural sector represents less than 1% of GNP.\n","Section::::Economy.:Heavy debt load.\n","In early 2017, the Puerto Rican government-debt crisis posed serious problems for the government which was saddled with outstanding bond debt that had climbed to $70\u00a0billion at a time with a 45-percent poverty rate and 12.4% unemployment that is more than twice the mainland U.S. average. The debt had been increasing during a decade-long recession.\n","The Commonwealth had been defaulting on many debts, including bonds, since 2015. With debt payments due, the governor was facing the risk of a government shutdown and failure to fund the managed health care system. \"Without action before April, Puerto Rico's ability to execute contracts for Fiscal Year 2018 with its managed care organizations will be threatened, thereby putting at risk beginning July 1, 2017 the health care of up to 900,000 poor U.S. citizens living in Puerto Rico\", according to a letter sent to Congress by the Secretary of the Treasury and the Secretary of Health and Human Services. They also said that \"Congress must enact measures recommended by both Republicans and Democrats that fix Puerto Rico's inequitable health care financing structure and promote sustained economic growth.\"\n","Initially, the oversight board created under PROMESA called for Puerto Rico's governor Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 to deliver a fiscal turnaround plan by January 28. Just before that deadline, the control board gave the Commonwealth government until February 28 to present a fiscal plan (including negotiations with creditors for restructuring debt) to solve the problems. A moratorium on lawsuits by debtors was extended to May 31. It is essential for Puerto Rico to reach restructuring deals to avoid a bankruptcy-like process under PROMESA. An internal survey conducted by the Puerto Rican Economists Association revealed that the majority of Puerto Rican economists reject the policy recommendations of the Board and the Rossell\u00f3 government, with more than 80% of economists arguing in favor of auditing the debt.\n","In early August 2017, the island's financial oversight board (created by PROMESA) planned to institute two days off without pay per month for government employees, down from the original plan of four days per month; the latter had been expected to achieve $218\u00a0million in savings. Governor Rossello rejected this plan as unjustified and unnecessary. Pension reforms were also discussed including a proposal for a 10% reduction in benefits to begin addressing the $50\u00a0billion in unfunded pension liabilities.\n","Section::::Economy.:Public finances.\n","Puerto Rico has an operating budget of about U.S.$9.8\u00a0billion with expenses at about $10.4\u00a0billion, creating a structural deficit of $775\u00a0million (about 7.9% of the budget). The practice of approving budgets with a structural deficit has been done for consecutive years starting in 2000. Throughout those years, including present time, all budgets contemplated issuing bonds to cover these projected deficits rather than making structural adjustments. This practice increased Puerto Rico's cumulative debt, as the government had already been issuing bonds to balance its actual budget for four decades beginning in 1973.\n","Projected deficits added substantial burdens to an already indebted nation which accrued a public debt of $71B or about 70% of Puerto Rico's gross domestic product. This sparked an ongoing government-debt crisis after Puerto Rico's general obligation bonds were downgraded to speculative non-investment grade (\"junk status\") by three credit-rating agencies. In terms of financial control, almost 9.6%\u2014or about $1.5\u00a0billion\u2014of Puerto Rico's central government budget expenses for FY2014 is expected to be spent on debt service. Harsher budget cuts are expected as Puerto Rico must now repay larger chunks of debts in the coming years.\n","For practical reasons the budget is divided into two aspects: a \"general budget\" which comprises the assignments funded exclusively by the Department of Treasury of Puerto Rico, and the \"consolidated budget\" which comprises the assignments funded by the general budget, by Puerto Rico's government-owned corporations, by revenue expected from loans, by the sale of government bonds, by subsidies extended by the federal government of the United States, and by other funds.\n","Both budgets contrast each other drastically, with the consolidated budget being usually thrice the size of the general budget; currently $29B and $9.0B respectively. Almost one out of every four dollars in the consolidated budget comes from U.S. federal subsidies while government-owned corporations compose more than 31% of the consolidated budget.\n","The critical aspects come from the sale of bonds, which comprise 7% of the consolidated budget \u2013 a ratio that increased annually due to the government's inability to prepare a balanced budget in addition to being incapable of generating enough income to cover all its expenses. In particular, the government-owned corporations add a heavy burden to the overall budget and public debt, as none is self-sufficient. For example, in FY2011 the government-owned corporations reported aggregated losses of more than $1.3B with the Puerto Rico Highways and Transportation Authority (PRHTA) reporting losses of $409M, the Puerto Rico Electric Power Authority (PREPA; the government monopoly that controls all electricity on the island) reporting losses of $272M, while the Puerto Rico Aqueducts and Sewers Authority (PRASA; the government monopoly that controls all water utilities on the island) reported losses of $112M.\n","Losses by government-owned corporations have been defrayed through the issuance of bonds compounding more than 40% of Puerto Rico's entire public debt today. Holistically, from FY2000\u2013FY2010 Puerto Rico's debt grew at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9% while GDP remained stagnant. This has not always provided a long-term solution. In early July 2017 for example, the PREPA power authority was effectively bankrupt after defaulting in a plan to restructure $9\u00a0billion in bond debt; the agency planned to seek Court protection.\n","In terms of protocol, the governor, together with the Puerto Rico Office of Management and Budget (OGP in Spanish), formulates the budget he believes is required to operate all government branches for the ensuing fiscal year. He then submits this formulation as a budget request to the Puerto Rican legislature before July 1, the date established by law as the beginning of Puerto Rico's fiscal year. While the constitution establishes that the request must be submitted \"at the beginning of each regular session\", the request is typically submitted during the first week of May as the regular sessions of the legislature begin in January and it would be impractical to submit a request so far in advance. Once submitted, the budget is then approved by the legislature, typically with amendments, through a joint resolution and is referred back to the governor for his approval. The governor then either approves it or vetoes it. If vetoed, the legislature can then either refer it back with amendments for the governor's approval, or approve it without the governor's consent by two-thirds of the bodies of each chamber.\n","Once the budget is approved, the Department of Treasury disburses funds to the Office of Management and Budget which in turn disburses the funds to the respective agencies, while the Puerto Rico Government Development Bank (the government's intergovernmental bank) manages all related banking affairs including those related to the government-owned corporations.\n","Section::::Economy.:Cost of living.\n","The cost of living in Puerto Rico is high and has increased over the past decade. San Juan's in particular is higher than Atlanta, Dallas, and Seattle but lower than Boston, Chicago, and New York City. One factor is housing prices which are comparable to Miami and Los Angeles, although property taxes are considerably lower than most places in the United States.\n","Statistics used for cost of living sometimes do not take into account certain costs, such as the high cost of electricity, which has hovered in the 24\u00a2 to 30\u00a2 range per kilowatt\/hour, two to three times the national average, increased travel costs for longer flights, additional shipping fees, and the loss of promotional participation opportunities for customers \"outside the continental United States\". While some online stores do offer free shipping on orders to Puerto Rico, many merchants exclude Hawaii, Alaska, Puerto Rico and other United States territories.\n","The household median income is stated as $19,350 and the mean income as $30,463 in the U.S. Census Bureau's 2015 update. The report also indicates that 45.5% of individuals are below the poverty level. The median home value in Puerto Rico ranges from U.S.$100,000 to U.S.$214,000, while the national median home value sits at $119,600.\n","One of the most cited contributors to the high cost of living in Puerto Rico is the Merchant Marine Act of 1920, also known as the Jones Act, which prevents foreign-flagged ships from carrying cargo between two American ports, a practice known as cabotage. Because of the Jones Act, foreign ships inbound with goods from Central and South America, Western Europe, and Africa cannot stop in Puerto Rico, offload Puerto Rico-bound goods, load mainland-bound Puerto Rico-manufactured goods, and continue to U.S. ports. Instead, they must proceed directly to U.S. ports, where distributors break bulk and send Puerto Rico-bound manufactured goods to Puerto Rico across the ocean by U.S.-flagged ships.\n","The local government of Puerto Rico has requested several times to the U.S. Congress to exclude Puerto Rico from the Jones Act restrictions without success. The most recent measure has been taken by the 17th Legislative Assembly of Puerto Rico through R. Conc. del S. 21. These measures have always received support from all the major local political parties.\n","In 2013 the Government Accountability Office published a report which concluded that \"repealing or amending the Jones Act cabotage law might cut Puerto Rico shipping costs\" and that \"shippers believed that opening the trade to non-U.S.-flag competition could lower costs\". However, the same GAO report also found that \"[shippers] doing business in Puerto Rico that GAO contacted reported that the freight rates are often\u2014although not always\u2014lower for foreign carriers going to and from Puerto Rico and foreign locations than the rates shippers pay to ship similar cargo to and from the United States, despite longer distances. Data were not available to allow us to validate the examples given or verify the extent to which this difference occurred.\" Ultimately, the report concluded that \"[the] effects of modifying the application of the Jones Act for Puerto Rico are highly uncertain\" for both Puerto Rico and the United States, particularly for the U.S. shipping industry and the military preparedness of the United States.\n","A 2018 study by economists at Boston-based Reeve & Associates and Puerto Rico-based Estudios Tecnicos has concluded that the Jones Act has no impact on either retail prices or the cost of livings on Puerto Rico. The study found that Puerto Rico received very similar or lower shipping freight rates when compared to neighboring islands, and that the transportation costs have no impact on retail prices on the island. The study was based in part on actual comparison of consumer goods at retail stores in San Juan, Puerto Rico, and Jacksonville, Florida, finding: no significant difference in the prices of either grocery items or durable goods between the two locations.\n","Section::::Education.\n","The first school in Puerto Rico was the \"Escuela de Gram\u00e1tica\" (Grammar School). It was established by Bishop Alonso Manso in 1513, in the area where the Cathedral of San Juan was to be constructed. The school was free of charge and the courses taught were Latin language, literature, history, science, art, philosophy and theology.\n","Education in Puerto Rico is divided in three levels\u2014Primary (elementary school grades 1\u20136), Secondary (intermediate and high school grades 7\u201312), and Higher Level (undergraduate and graduate studies). As of 2002, the literacy rate of the Puerto Rican population was 94.1%; by gender, it was 93.9% for males and 94.4% for females. According to the 2000 Census, 60.0% of the population attained a high school degree or higher level of education, and 18.3% has a bachelor's degree or higher.\n","Instruction at the primary school level is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 18. , there are 1539 public schools and 806 private schools.\n","The largest and oldest university system is the public University of Puerto Rico (UPR) with 11 campuses. The largest private university systems on the island are the Sistema Universitario Ana G. Mendez which operates the Universidad del Turabo, Metropolitan University and Universidad del Este. Other private universities include the multi-campus Inter American University, the Pontifical Catholic University, Universidad Polit\u00e9cnica de Puerto Rico, and the Universidad del Sagrado Coraz\u00f3n. Puerto Rico has four schools of Medicine and three ABA-approved Law Schools.\n","Section::::Public health and safety.\n",", medical care in Puerto Rico had been heavily impacted by emigration of doctors to the mainland and underfunding of the Medicare and Medicaid programs which serve 60% of the island's population. Since Puerto Ricans pay no income tax, they are not eligible for health insurance subsidies under the Affordable Care Act.\n","The city of San Juan has a system of triage, hospital, and preventive care health services. The municipal government sponsors regular health fairs in different areas of the city focusing on health care for the elderly and the disabled.\n","In 2017, there were 69 hospitals in Puerto Rico.\n","There are twenty hospitals in San Juan, half of which are operated by the government. The largest hospital is the \"Centro M\u00e9dico de R\u00edo Piedras\" (the R\u00edo Piedras Medical Center). Founded in 1956, it is operated by the Medical Services Administration of the Department of Health of Puerto Rico, and is actually a network of eight hospitals:\n","The city of San Juan operates nine other hospitals. Of these, eight are Diagnostic and Treatment Centers located in communities throughout San Juan. These nine hospitals are:\n","There are also ten private hospitals in San Juan. These are:\n","The city of Ponce is served by several clinics and hospitals. There are four comprehensive care hospitals: Hospital Dr. Pila, Hospital San Cristobal, Hospital San Lucas, and Hospital de Damas. In addition, Hospital Oncol\u00f3gico Andr\u00e9s Grillasca specializes in the treatment of cancer, and Hospital Siqui\u00e1trico specializes in mental disorders. There is also a U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs Outpatient Clinic that provides health services to U.S. veterans. The U.S. Veterans Administration will build a new hospital in the city to satisfy regional needs. Hospital de Damas is listed in the U.S. News & World Report as one of the best hospitals under the U.S. flag. Ponce has the highest concentration of medical infrastructure per inhabitant of any municipality in Puerto Rico.\n","On the island of Culebra, there is a small hospital in the island called \"Hospital de Culebra\". It also offers pharmacy services to residents and visitors. For emergencies, patients are transported by plane to Fajardo on the main island.\n","The town of Caguas has three hospitals: Hospital Hima San Pablo, Menonita Caguas Regional Hospital, and the San Juan Bautista Medical Center.\n","The town of Cayey is served by the \"Hospital Menonita de Cayey\", and the \"Hospital Municipal de Cayey.\"\n","\"Reforma de Salud de Puerto Rico\" (Puerto Rico Health Reform) \u2013 locally referred to as \"La Reforma\" (The Reform) \u2013 is a government-run program which provides medical and health care services to the indigent and impoverished, by means of contracting private health insurance companies, rather than employing government-owned hospitals and emergency centers. The Reform is administered by the Puerto Rico Health Insurance Administration.\n","Section::::Public health and safety.:Crime.\n","The overall rate of crime is low in Puerto Rico. The territory has a high firearm homicide rate. The homicide rate of 19.2 per 100,000 inhabitants was significantly higher than any U.S. state in 2014. Most homicide victims are gang members and drug traffickers with about 80% of homicides in Puerto Rico being drug related.\n","Carjackings happen often in many areas of Puerto Rico. In 1992, the FBI made it a Federal crime and rates decreased per statistics, but as of 2019, the problem continued in municipalities like Guaynabo and others. From January 1, 2019, to March 14, 2019, thirty carjackings had occurred on the island.\n","Section::::Culture.\n","Modern Puerto Rican culture is a unique mix of cultural antecedents: including European (predominantly Spanish, Italian, French, German and Irish), African, and, more recently, some North American and lots of South Americans. A large number of Cubans and Dominicans have relocated to the island in the past few decades.\n","From the Spanish, Puerto Rico received the Spanish language, the Catholic religion and the vast majority of their cultural and moral values and traditions. The United States added English-language influence, the university system and the adoption of some holidays and practices. On March 12, 1903, the University of Puerto Rico was officially founded, branching out from the \"Escuela Normal Industrial\", a smaller organization that was founded in Fajardo three years before.\n","Much of Puerto Rican culture centers on the influence of music and has been shaped by other cultures combining with local and traditional rhythms. Early in the history of Puerto Rican music, the influences of Spanish and African traditions were most noticeable. The cultural movements across the Caribbean and North America have played a vital role in the more recent musical influences which have reached Puerto Rico.\n","The official symbols of Puerto Rico are the \"reinita mora\" or Puerto Rican spindalis (a type of bird), the \"flor de maga\" (a type of flower), and the \"ceiba\" or kapok (a type of tree). The unofficial animal and a symbol of Puerto Rican pride is the coqu\u00ed, a small frog. Other popular symbols of Puerto Rico are the \"j\u00edbaro\" (the \"countryman\"), and the carite.\n","Section::::Culture.:Architecture.\n","The architecture of Puerto Rico demonstrates a broad variety of traditions, styles and national influences accumulated over four centuries of Spanish rule, and a century of American rule. Spanish colonial architecture, Ibero-Islamic, art deco, post-modern, and many other architectural forms are visible throughout the island. From town to town, there are also many regional distinctions.\n","Old San Juan is one of the two \"barrios\", in addition to Santurce, that made up the municipality of San Juan from 1864 to 1951, at which time the former independent municipality of R\u00edo Piedras was annexed. With its abundance of shops, historic places, museums, open air caf\u00e9s, restaurants, gracious homes, tree-shaded plazas, and its old beauty and architectonical peculiarity, Old San Juan is a main spot for local and internal tourism. The district is also characterized by numerous public plazas and churches including San Jos\u00e9 Church and the Cathedral of San Juan Bautista, which contains the tomb of the Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n. It also houses the oldest Catholic school for elementary education in Puerto Rico, the Colegio de P\u00e1rvulos, built in 1865.\n","The oldest parts of the district of Old San Juan remain partly enclosed by massive walls. Several defensive structures and notable forts, such as the emblematic Fort San Felipe del Morro, Fort San Crist\u00f3bal, and El Palacio de Santa Catalina, also known as La Fortaleza, acted as the primary defenses of the settlement which was subjected to numerous attacks. La Fortaleza continues to serve also as the executive mansion for the governor of Puerto Rico. Many of the historic fortifications are part of San Juan National Historic Site.\n","During the 1940s, sections of Old San Juan fell into disrepair, and many renovation plans were suggested. There was even a strong push to develop Old San Juan as a \"small Manhattan\". Strict remodeling codes were implemented to prevent new constructions from affecting the common colonial Spanish architectural themes of the old city. When a project proposal suggested that the old Carmelite Convent in San Juan be demolished to erect a new hotel, the Institute had the building declared as a historic building, and then asked that it be converted to a hotel in a renewed facility. This was what became the \"Hotel El Convento\" in Old San Juan. The paradigm to reconstruct and renovate the old city and revitalize it has been followed by other cities in the Americas, particularly Havana, Lima and Cartagena de Indias.\n","Ponce Creole is an architectural style created in Ponce, Puerto Rico, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. This style of Puerto Rican buildings is found predominantly in residential homes in Ponce that developed between 1895 and 1920. Ponce Creole architecture borrows heavily from the traditions of the French, the Spaniards, and the Caribbean to create houses that were especially built to withstand the hot and dry climate of the region, and to take advantage of the sun and sea breezes characteristic of the southern Puerto Rico's Caribbean Sea coast. It is a blend of wood and masonry, incorporating architectural elements of other styles, from Classical revival and Spanish Revival to Victorian.\n","Section::::Culture.:Arts.\n","Puerto Rican art reflects many influences, much from its ethnically diverse background. A form of folk art, called \"santos\" evolved from the Catholic Church's use of sculptures to convert indigenous Puerto Ricans to Christianity. \"Santos\" depict figures of saints and other religious icons and are made from native wood, clay, and stone. After shaping simple, they are often finished by painting them in vivid colors. \"Santos\" vary in size, with the smallest examples around eight inches tall and the largest about twenty inches tall. Traditionally, santos were seen as messengers between the earth and Heaven. As such, they occupied a special place on household altars, where people prayed to them, asked for help, or tried to summon their protection.\n","Also popular, \"caretas\" or \"vejigantes\" are masks worn during carnivals. Similar masks signifying evil spirits were used in both Spain and Africa, though for different purposes. The Spanish used their masks to frighten lapsed Christians into returning to the church, while tribal Africans used them as protection from the evil spirits they represented. True to their historic origins, Puerto Rican \"caretas\" always bear at least several horns and fangs. While usually constructed of papier-m\u00e2ch\u00e9, coconut shells and fine metal screening are sometimes used as well. Red and black were the typical colors for \"caretas\" but their palette has expanded to include a wide variety of bright hues and patterns.\n","Section::::Culture.:Literature.\n","Puerto Rican literature evolved from the art of oral story telling to its present-day status. Written works by the native islanders of Puerto Rico were prohibited and repressed by the Spanish colonial government. Only those who were commissioned by the Spanish Crown to document the chronological history of the island were allowed to write.\n","Diego de Torres Vargas was allowed to circumvent this strict prohibition for three reasons: he was a priest, he came from a prosperous Spanish family, and his father was a Sergeant Major in the Spanish Army, who died while defending Puerto Rico from an invasion by the Dutch armada. In 1647, Torres Vargas wrote \"Descripci\u00f3n de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico\" (\"Description of the Island and City of Puerto Rico\"). This historical book was the first to make a detailed geographic description of the island.\n","The book described all the fruits and commercial establishments of the time, mostly centered in the towns of San Juan and Ponce. The book also listed and described every mine, church, and hospital in the island at the time. The book contained notices on the State and Capital, plus an extensive and erudite bibliography. \"Descripci\u00f3n de la Ciudad e Isla de Puerto Rico\" was the first successful attempt at writing a comprehensive history of Puerto Rico.\n","Some of Puerto Rico's earliest writers were influenced by the teachings of Rafael Cordero. Among these was Dr. Manuel A. Alonso, the first Puerto Rican writer of notable importance. In 1849 he published \"El G\u00edbaro\", a collection of verses whose main themes were the poor Puerto Rican country farmer. Eugenio Mar\u00eda de Hostos wrote \"La peregrinaci\u00f3n de Bayo\u00e1n\" in 1863, which used Bartolom\u00e9 de las Casas as a spring board to reflect on Caribbean identity. After this first novel, Hostos abandoned fiction in favor of the essay which he saw as offering greater possibilities for inspiring social change.\n","In the late 19th century, with the arrival of the first printing press and the founding of the Royal Academy of Belles Letters, Puerto Rican literature began to flourish. The first writers to express their political views in regard to Spanish colonial rule of the island were journalists. After the United States invaded Puerto Rico during the Spanish\u2013American War and the island was ceded to the Americans as a condition of the Treaty of Paris of 1898, writers and poets began to express their opposition to the new colonial rule by writing about patriotic themes.\n","Alejandro Tapia y Rivera, also known as the Father of Puerto Rican Literature, ushered in a new age of historiography with the publication of \"The Historical Library of Puerto Rico\". Cayetano Coll y Toste was another Puerto Rican historian and writer. His work \"The Indo-Antillano Vocabulary\" is valuable in understanding the way the Ta\u00ednos lived. Dr. Manuel Zeno Gand\u00eda in 1894 wrote \"La Charca\" and told about the harsh life in the remote and mountainous coffee regions in Puerto Rico. Dr. Antonio S. Pedreira, described in his work \"Insularismo\" the cultural survival of the Puerto Rican identity after the American invasion.\n","With the Puerto Rican diaspora of the 1940s, Puerto Rican literature was greatly influenced by a phenomenon known as the Nuyorican Movement. Puerto Rican literature continued to flourish and many Puerto Ricans have since distinguished themselves as authors, journalists, poets, novelists, playwrights, screenwriters, essayists and have also stood out in other literary fields. The influence of Puerto Rican literature has transcended the boundaries of the island to the United States and the rest of the world. Over the past fifty years, significant writers include Ed Vega, Luis Rafael S\u00e1nchez, Piri Thomas, Giannina Braschi, and Miguel Pi\u00f1ero. Esmeralda Santiago has written an autobiographical trilogy about growing up in modern Puerto Rico as well as an historical novel, \"Conquistadora\", about life on a sugar plantation during the mid-19th century.\n","Section::::Culture.:Media.\n","The media in Puerto Rico includes local radio stations, television stations and newspapers, the majority of which are conducted in Spanish. There are also three stations of the U.S. Armed Forces Radio and Television Service. Newspapers with daily distribution are El Nuevo Dia, El Vocero and Indice, Metro, and Primera Hora. El Vocero is distributed free of charge as well as Indice and Metro.\n","Newspapers distributed on a weekly or regional basis include Claridad, La Perla del Sur, La Opinion, Vision, and La Estrella del Norte, among others. Several television channels provide local content in the island. These include WIPR-TV, Telemundo, Univision Puerto Rico, WAPA-TV, and WKAQ-TV.\n","Section::::Culture.:Music.\n","The music of Puerto Rico has evolved as a heterogeneous and dynamic product of diverse cultural resources. The most conspicuous musical sources have been Spain and West Africa, although many aspects of Puerto Rican music reflect origins elsewhere in Europe and the Caribbean and, over the last century, from the U.S. Puerto Rican music culture today comprises a wide and rich variety of genres, ranging from indigenous genres like bomba, plena, aguinaldo, danza and salsa to recent hybrids like reggaeton.\n","Puerto Rico has some national instruments, like the cuatro (Spanish for \"four\"). The cuatro is a local instrument that was made by the \"Jibaro\" or people from the mountains. Originally, the Cuatro consisted of four steel strings, hence its name, but currently the Cuatro consists of five double steel strings. It is easily confused with a guitar, even by locals. When held upright, from right to left, the strings are G, D, A, E, B.\n","In the realm of classical music, the island hosts two main orchestras, the Orquesta Sinf\u00f3nica de Puerto Rico and the Orquesta Filarm\u00f3nica de Puerto Rico. The Casals Festival takes place annually in San Juan, drawing in classical musicians from around the world.\n","With respect to opera, the legendary Puerto Rican tenor Antonio Paoli was so celebrated, that he performed private recitals for Pope Pius X and the Czar Nicholas II of Russia. In 1907, Paoli was the first operatic artist in world history to record an entire opera \u2013 when he participated in a performance of \"Pagliacci\" by Ruggiero Leoncavallo in Milan, Italy.\n","Over the past fifty years, Puerto Rican artists such as Jorge Emmanuelli, Yomo Toro, Ramito, Jose Feliciano, Bobby Capo, Rafael Cortijo, Ismael Rivera, Chayanne, Tito Puente, Eddie Palmieri, Ray Barreto, Dave Valentin, Omar Rodr\u00edguez-L\u00f3pez, Hector Lavoe, Ricky Martin, Marc Anthony and Luis Fonsi have gained fame internationally.\n","Section::::Culture.:Cuisine.\n","Puerto Rican cuisine has its roots in the cooking traditions and practices of Europe (Spain), Africa and the native Ta\u00ednos. In the latter part of the 19th century, the cuisine of Puerto Rico was greatly influenced by the United States in the ingredients used in its preparation. Puerto Rican cuisine has transcended the boundaries of the island, and can be found in several countries outside the archipelago. Basic ingredients include grains and legumes, herbs and spices, starchy tropical tubers, vegetables, meat and poultry, seafood and shellfish, and fruits. Main dishes include \"mofongo\", \"arroz con gandules\", \"pasteles\", \"alcapurrias\" and pig roast (or lech\u00f3n). Beverages include \"mav\u00ed\" and \"pi\u00f1a colada\". Desserts include flan, \"arroz con dulce\" (sweet rice pudding), \"piraguas\", \"brazo gitanos\", \"tembleque\", \"polvorones\", and \"dulce de leche\".\n","Locals call their cuisine cocina criolla. The traditional Puerto Rican cuisine was well established by the end of the 19th century. By 1848 the first restaurant, La Mallorquina, opened in Old San Juan. \"El Cocinero Puertorrique\u00f1o\", the island's first cookbook was published in 1849.\n","From the diet of the Ta\u00edno people come many tropical roots and tubers like \"yaut\u00eda\" (taro) and especially \"Yuca\" (cassava), from which thin cracker-like \"casabe\" bread is made. Ajicito or cachucha pepper, a slightly hot habanero pepper, \"recao\/culantro\" (spiny leaf), \"achiote\" (annatto), \"peppers\", \"aj\u00ed caballero\" (the hottest pepper native to Puerto Rico), peanuts, guavas, pineapples, \"jicacos\" (cocoplum), \"quenepas\" (mamoncillo), \"lerenes\" (Guinea arrowroot), \"calabazas\" (tropical pumpkins), and \"guanabanas\" (soursops) are all Ta\u00edno foods. The Ta\u00ednos also grew varieties of beans and some maize\/corn, but maize was not as dominant in their cooking as it was for the peoples living on the mainland of Mesoamerica. This is due to the frequent hurricanes that Puerto Rico experiences, which destroy crops of maize, leaving more safeguarded plants like \"conucos\" (hills of \"yuca\" grown together).\n","Spanish \/ European influence is also seen in Puerto Rican cuisine. Wheat, chickpeas (garbanzos), capers, olives, olive oil, black pepper, onions, garlic, \"cilantrillo\" (cilantro), oregano, basil, sugarcane, citrus fruit, eggplant, ham, lard, chicken, beef, pork, and cheese all came to Borik\u00e9n (Puerto Rico's native Taino name) from Spain. The tradition of cooking complex stews and rice dishes in pots such as rice and beans are also thought to be originally European (much like Italians, Spaniards, and the British). Early Dutch, French, Italian, and Chinese immigrants influenced not only the culture but Puerto Rican cooking as well. This great variety of traditions came together to form La Cocina Criolla.\n","Coconuts, coffee (brought by the Arabs and Corsos to Yauco from Kafa, Ethiopia), okra, yams, sesame seeds, \"gandules\" (pigeon peas in English) sweet bananas, plantains, other root vegetables and Guinea hen, all come to Puerto Rico from Africa.\n","Section::::Culture.:Philately.\n","Puerto Rico has been commemorated on four U.S. postal stamps and four personalities have been featured.

{"kilt_id":"30339","wikipedia_id":"30339","wikipedia_title":"Tetris","text":{"paragraph":["Tetris\n","Tetris ( ; portmanteau of \"tetromino\" and \"tennis\") is a tile-matching puzzle video game originally designed and programmed by Soviet Russian game designer Alexey Leonidovich Pajitnov (). The first playable version was completed on June 6, 1984, while he was working for the Dorodnitsyn Computing Centre of the Academy of Science of the Soviet Union in Moscow. He derived its name from the Greek numerical prefix \"tetra-\" (all of the game's pieces contain four segments) and tennis, Pajitnov's favorite sport. The name is also used in-game to refer to the play where four lines are cleared at once.\n","\"Tetris\" was the first entertainment software to be exported from the Soviet Union to the United States, where it was published by Spectrum HoloByte for the Commodore 64 and IBM PC. The game is a popular use of tetrominoes, the four-element case of polyominoes, which have been used in popular puzzles since at least 1907. (The name for these figures was given by the mathematician Solomon W. Golomb in 1953.)\n","The game, or one of its many variants, is available for nearly every video game console and computer operating system, as well as on devices such as graphing calculators, mobile phones, portable media players, PDAs, Network music players, and as an Easter egg on non-media products like oscilloscopes. It has inspired \"Tetris\" serving dishes, and it has even been played on the sides of various buildings.\n","While versions of \"Tetris\" were sold for a range of 1980s home computer platforms as well as arcades, it was the successful handheld version for the Game Boy, launched in 1989, that established the game as one of the most popular video games ever. \"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s 100th issue had \"Tetris\" in first place as \"Greatest Game of All Time\". In 2007, it came in second place in IGN's \"100 Greatest Video Games of All Time\" (by 2019, it had moved down to 7th). In January 2010, it was announced that the games in the franchise had sold more than 170 million copies\u2014approximately 70 million physical copies, and over 100 million copies for cell phones\u2014making it the second best selling paid-downloaded game of all time, behind \"Minecraft\".\n","Section::::Gameplay.\n","Tetriminos are game pieces shaped like tetrominoes, geometric shapes composed of four square blocks each. A random sequence of Tetriminos fall down the playing field (a rectangular vertical shaft, called the \"well\" or \"matrix\"). The objective of the game is to manipulate these Tetriminos, by moving each one sideways and\/or rotating by quarter-turns, so that they form a solid horizontal line without gaps. When such a line is formed, it disappears and any blocks above it fall down to fill the space. When a certain number of lines are cleared, the game enters a new level. As the game progresses, each level causes the Tetriminos to fall faster, and the game ends when the stack of Tetriminos reaches the top of the playing field and no new Tetriminos are able to enter. Some games also end after a finite number of levels or lines.\n","All of the Tetriminos can fill and clear both singles and doubles. \"I\", \"J\", and \"L\" are able to clear triples. Only the \"I\" Tetrimino has the capacity to clear four lines simultaneously, and this is referred to as a \"tetris\". (This may vary depending on the rotation and compensation rules of each specific \"Tetris\" implementation. For instance, in the Super Rotation System used in most recent implementations, certain situations allow \"T\", \"S\", and \"Z\" to 'snap' into tight spots and clear triples.)\n","Section::::Gameplay.:Tetromino colors.\n","Pajitnov's original version for the Electronika 60 computer used green brackets to represent blocks. Versions of \"Tetris\" on the original Game Boy\/Game Boy Color and on most dedicated handheld games use monochrome or grayscale graphics, but most popular versions use a separate color for each distinct shape. Prior to The Tetris Company's standardization in the early 2000s, those colors varied widely from implementation to implementation.\n","Section::::Gameplay.:Scoring.\n","The scoring formula for the majority of \"Tetris\" products is built on the idea that more difficult line clears should be awarded more points. For example, a single line clear in \"Tetris Zone\" is worth 100 points, clearing four lines at once (known as a \"Tetris\") is worth 800, while each subsequent back-to-back \"Tetris\" is worth 1,200. In conjunction, players can be awarded combos that exist in certain games which reward multiple line clears in quick succession. The exact conditions for triggering combos, and the amount of importance assigned to them, vary from game to game.\n","Nearly all \"Tetris\" games allow the player to press a button to increase the speed of the current piece's descent or cause the piece to drop and lock into place immediately, known as a \"soft drop\" and a \"hard drop\", respectively. While performing a soft drop, the player can also stop the piece's increased speed by releasing the button before the piece settles into place. Some games only allow either soft drop or hard drop; others have separate buttons for both. Many games award a number of points based on the height that the piece fell before locking, so using the hard drop generally awards more points.\n","Section::::Gameplay.:Easy spin dispute.\n","Although not the first \"Tetris\" game to feature a new kind of \"Tetris\", \"easy spin\" (see \"The Next Tetris\"), also called \"infinite spin\" by critics, \"Tetris Worlds\" was the first game to fall under major criticisms for it. Easy spin refers to the property of a Tetrimino to stop falling for a moment after left or right movement or rotation, effectively allowing someone to suspend the Tetrimino while thinking on where to place it. This feature has been implemented into The Tetris Company's official guideline. This type of play differs from traditional \"Tetris\" because it takes away the pressure of higher level speed. Some reviewers went so far as to say that this mechanism broke the game. The goal in \"Tetris Worlds\", however, is to complete a certain number of lines as fast as possible, so the ability to hold off a piece's placement will not make achieving that goal any faster. Later, GameSpot received \"easy spin\" more openly, saying that \"the infinite spin issue honestly really affects only a few of the single-player gameplay modes in \"Tetris DS\", because any competitive mode requires you to lay down pieces as quickly as humanly possible.\" In response to the issue, Henk Rogers stated in an interview that infinite spin was an intentional part of the game design, allowing novice players to expend some of their available scoring time to decide on the best placement of a piece. Rogers observed that \"gratuitous spinning\" does not occur in competitive play, as expert players do not require much time to think about where a piece should be placed. A limitation has been placed on infinite lock delay in later games of the franchise, where after a certain amount of inputs i.e: rotations and movements, the piece will instantly lock itself. This is defaulted to 15 inputs.\n","Section::::History.\n","\"Tetris\" was created in June 1984 by Alexey Pajitnov, an artificial intelligence researcher working for the Soviet Academy of Sciences at Computer Center in Moscow. Tasked with testing the capabilities of new hardware, Pajitnov would do so by writing simple games for them. He initially considered creating a game around pentominoes, which featured in puzzle games that he had enjoyed as a child, but felt that it might have been too complicated with twelve different shape variations, so the concept switched to tetrominoes, of which there are seven variants. The Electronika 60 on which he was working had only a text-based display, so the tetrominoes were formed of letter characters. Realizing that completed lines resulted in the screen filling up quickly, Pajitnov decided to delete them, creating a key part of \"Tetris\" gameplay.\n","Pajitnov's game proved popular with his colleagues. Academy of Sciences co-workers Dmitry Pavlovsky and Vadim Gerasimov ported the game to the IBM PC. Gerasimov reports that Pajitnov chose the name \"Tetris\" as \"a combination of 'tetromino' and 'tennis'\". From there, the PC game became popular and began spreading around Moscow. Gerasimov removed his 1988 version of the game from his website in October 2003, in response to a demand from counsel for The Tetris Company. He resumed making it available in August 2006.\n","The PC version made its way to Budapest, Hungary, where it was ported to various platforms and was \"discovered\" by British software house Andromeda. They attempted to contact Pajitnov to secure the rights for the PC version, but before the deal was firmly settled, they had already sold the rights to Spectrum HoloByte. After failing to settle the deal with Pajitnov, Andromeda attempted to license it from the Hungarian programmers instead.\n","Meanwhile, before any legal rights were settled, the Spectrum HoloByte IBM PC version of \"Tetris\", which contained background graphics featuring Russian scenes, was released in the United States in 1987. The game's popularity was tremendous; \"Computer Gaming World\" called the game \"deceptively simple and insidiously addictive\".\n","The details of the licensing issues were uncertain by this point, but in 1987 Andromeda managed to obtain copyright licensing for the IBM PC and any other home computer system. Their Commodore 64 release in 1988 has a 26-minute soundtrack composed by game musician Wally Beben.\n","For Amiga and Atari ST, two different versions by Mirrorsoft (1987) and Spectrum HoloByte (1988) became available. The Mirrorsoft version did not feature any background graphics, while Spectrum HoloByte's version was similar to their PC version and contained the similar images (it was also distributed by Infogrames in some regions). The games were sold as budget titles due to the game's simplicity. Spectrum's Apple II package contained three diskettes with three different versions of the game, for the Apple II+ and Apple IIe on separate DOS 3.3 and ProDOS diskettes, and for the Apple IIgs on a diskette, none of which was copy-protected: the included documentation specifically charged the purchaser on their honor to not give away or copy the extra diskettes.\n","Unsure of how to publish his game and fearful of the response of the Soviet regime if he did so, Pajitnov took the opportunity offered by Perestroika and gave the rights to the Soviet government for ten years. In 1988, the Soviet government began to market the rights to \"Tetris\", following a promotional trip to the country by Gerald Hicks, the one-time United States champion of the game, through an organization called Elektronorgtechnica, or \"Elorg\" for short. At this time, Elorg had still not been paid by Andromeda, but Andromeda was licensing and sub-licensing the rights to the game. A different version of \"Tetris\" was originally released in late 1988 by Bullet-Proof Software (BPS) for several Japanese home computers as well as the MSX and the Family Computer in Japan, predating Nintendo's version. An unlicensed arcade version was released in South Korea, as well as an unlicensed Master System (titled Super Tetris (\uc288\ud37c \ud14c\ud2b8\ub9ac\uc2a4 \"Syupeo Teteuriseu\")).\n","Section::::History.:Nintendo.\n","By 1989, half a dozen different companies claimed rights to create and distribute the \"Tetris\" software for home computers, game consoles and handheld systems. Elorg, meanwhile, held that none of the companies was legally entitled to produce an arcade version, and signed those rights over to Atari Games, while it signed non-Japanese console and handheld rights over to Nintendo. \"Tetris\" was on show at the January 1988 Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, where it was picked up by Dutch games publisher Henk Rogers, then based in Japan, which eventually led to an agreement brokered with Nintendo that saw \"Tetris\" bundled with every Game Boy. Rogers later stated, \"\"Tetris\" made Game Boy and Game Boy made \"Tetris\".\"\n","Section::::History.:Nintendo.:Tengen.\n","Tengen (the console software division of Atari Games), regardless, applied for copyright for their \"Tetris\" game for the Nintendo Entertainment System, loosely based on the arcade version, and proceeded to market and distribute it under the name \"TET\u042fIS: The Soviet Mind Game\" (with faux Cyrillic typography incorporating the Cyrillic letter Ya), disregarding Nintendo's license from Elorg. Nintendo contacted Atari Games claiming they had stolen rights to \"Tetris\", whereupon Atari Games sued, believing they had the rights. After four weeks on the shelf, the courts ruled that Nintendo was the only company which had the rights to \"Tetris\" on home game systems. Tengen's \"TET\u042fIS\" was recalled with an unknown number of copies sold. The lawsuits between Tengen and Nintendo over the NES version carried on until 1993. The Tengen version of \"TET\u042fIS\" is considered rare.\n","Section::::History.:Nintendo.:NES and Gameboy.\n","Nintendo released their version of \"Tetris\" for the Nintendo Entertainment System (NES), developed by Gunpei Yokoi. The NES version sold 8 million copies worldwide. Nintendo's NES version lacked the side-by-side 2-player option featured in Tengen's version. \"Nintendo Power\" reviewed this version in its November \/ December 1989 edition. The Classic Tetris World Championship commenced in 2010 and uses the Nintendo version of \"Tetris\".\n","Section::::History.:Nintendo.:SNES.\n","Nintendo released the game again for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System (SNES) along with Dr Mario. The new version used different colors than older versions, and makes the squares look more connected. This version is similar to the version released on the NES.\n","Section::::History.:Nintendo.:Tetris 99.\n","On February 13, 2019, Nintendo announced and released a new version of the classic game called Tetris 99. Tetris 99 features a battle royale-style game mode where 99 players play in the same match. In addition to complying with the Tetris Guideline, this version of the game features a unique mechanic known as \"badges.\" Badges lessen the severity of attacks received and amplifies the attacks sent. Players can gain badges by knocking out others who have them. Tetris 99 is only available on the Nintendo Switch.\n","Section::::History.:Sega.\n","In 1988, an arcade version was released by Sega in Japan for the Sega System 16 and System E arcade boards. It won the Japanese Gamest Award for Game of the Year the following year. A version for the Sega Mega Drive was originally planned for release in Japan, but was pulled following licensing issues, resulting in less than ten copies being printed. A new port of the arcade version by M2 (unrelated to the rare Mega Drive version) will be included in the Sega Genesis Mini microconsole, scheduled for release in September 2019.\n","Sega's arcade version was commercially successful in Japanese arcades. On \"Famicom Ts\u016bshin\"s arcade earnings chart, it was number-three in August 1989 and September 1989. It rose to number two in October 1989, overtaking Namco's racing video game \"Winning Run\".\n","In 2014, in conjunction with the 30th anniversary of the series, Sega released \"Puyo Puyo Tetris\", a multi-platform game that blends gameplay elements of both the \"Tetris\" and \"Puyo Puyo\" franchises.\n","Section::::History.:The Tetris Company.\n","In 1996, the rights to the game reverted from the Russian state to Pajitnov himself, who previously had made very little money from the game. That year, The Tetris Company was founded, claiming to hold copyright registrations for \"Tetris\" products in the U.S. and taking out trademark registrations for \"Tetris\" in almost every country in the world. They have licensed the brand to a number of companies, and the U.S. Court of International Trade and the U.S. Customs have at times issued seizure orders to preclude unlicensed \"Tetris\"-like games from being imported into the U.S., though bulletins circulated by the U.S. Copyright Office state that copyright does not apply to the rules of a game.\n","In mid-2006, and in late 1997, TTC's legal counsel sent cease and desist letters to Web sites on the basis of \"Tetris\"-type games infringing the \"Tetris\" trademark, trade dress, and\/or \"look and feel\" copyright. Around 2009, TTC and Tetris Holding LLC brought legal action against BioSocia, Inc., on the grounds that BioSocia's \"Blockles\" game infringed on proprietary rights that were held by TTC and Tetris Holding LLC. On September 10, 2009, the legal case against BioSocia was resolved, with BioSocia agreeing to discontinue making the \"Blockles\" game available to the public. In May 2010, TTC's legal counsel sent cease and desist letters to Google insisting that 35 \"Tetris\" clones be removed from the Android Market. A US District Court judge ruled in June 2012 that the \"Tetris\" clone \"Mino\" from Xio Interactive infringed on The Tetris Company's copyrights by replicating such elements as the playfield dimensions and the shapes of the blocks. In addition, it was ruled that Tetris Holding LLC's trade dress had been infringed because \"Mino\" had replicated the form and brightly colored style of the \"Tetris\" Tetriminos and the higher-than-wide rectangular \"Tetris\" playfield.\"\n","Based on the success of \"Tetris 99\", the Tetris Company and N3TWORK are developing \"Tetris Royale\", an iOS and Android version of \"Tetris\" that will include a battle royale mode for 100 players, along with other solo and multiplayer modes. It is expected for release in 2019.\n","Section::::Variations.\n","\"Tetris\" has been subject to many changes throughout releases since the 1980s. Newer \"Tetris\" games have focused on a trend of pace rather than endurance. Older releases such as Game Boy or NES \"Tetris\" offer records according to points. Since the meter for points is restricted to a specific number of digits, these games' records can be \"maxed out\" by an experienced player. The next big Game Boy release after \"Tetris\", \"Tetris DX\", in marathon mode\u2014comparable to mode A in previous releases\u2014allowed an additional digit for the point meter. Even so, players still maxed it to 9,999,999\u00a0points after hours of play. For \"The New Tetris\", world record competitors have spent over 12\u00a0hours playing the same game. In \"Tetris DX\" and \"The New Tetris\", the new modes sprint and ultra were added. These modes require the player to act under a timer, either to gain the most lines or points in that time. Releases like \"Tetris Worlds\" removed point records. This particular game kept records by how fast a certain number of lines could be cleared depending on the level. Critics of \"Tetris Worlds\" said it was flawed by virtue of the ability of a piece to hover over the bottom for as long as a player needs.\n","There are many different modes of play added in recent years. Modes appearing in more than one major release include classic marathon (game A), sprint (otherwise game B or 40 lines), ultra, square, and cascade.\n","The field dimension of \"Tetris\" is perhaps the least deviated among releases: almost always 10 cells wide by 20 high. Some releases on handheld platforms with small screens have smaller fields; for example, the \"Tetris Jr.\" keychain game has 8 by 12, and \"Tetris\" for Game Boy has 10 by 18.\n","Traditionally, blocks spawn within the four most central columns and the two highest rows. The \"I\" Tetrimino occupies columns 4, 5, 6 and 7, the \"O\" Tetrimino occupies columns 5 and 6, and the remaining 5 Tetriminos occupy columns 4, 5 and 6 (or in some, especially older, versions, 5, 6 and 7). In some more recent games, pieces spawn above the visible playfield.\n","In traditional games, a level-up would occur once every ten lines are cleared. In some newer games such as \"Tetris Worlds\", the number of lines required varies upon each new level. After a level-up, points awarded are increased and the blocks fall slightly faster. For example, NES \"Tetris\" operates at 60 frames per second. At level 0, a piece falls one step every 48 frames, and at level 19, a piece falls one step every 2 frames. Level increments either terminate at a certain point (Game Boy \"Tetris\" tops off at level 20) or increase forever yet not in speed after a certain point. NES \"Tetris\" will level up in speed until level 29 (due to limitations of the game's engine, pieces are not capable of dropping faster than this), but tool-assisted emulation will show that the level indicator increases indefinitely\u2014eventually leading to a glitch where the meter displays non-numeric characters. Modern games such as \"Tetris the Grand Master\" or \"Tetris Worlds\", at their highest levels, opt to drop a piece more than one row per frame. Pieces will appear to reach the bottom as soon as they spawn. As a result, these games have a delay that lets the player slide the piece on the bottom for a moment to help deal with an otherwise unplayable fall speed. In some games, the hover time is regenerated after a piece is moved or rotated.\n","Soft drops were first implemented in Nintendo releases of \"Tetris\" so that pieces would be able to drop faster while not locking as to slide into gaps. The other option is hard dropping, which originated in early PC games such as \"Microsoft Tetris\", a game developed by Dave Edson and bundled with Microsoft Entertainment Pack. With hard dropping, a piece falls and locks in one frame. Newer \"Tetris\" games feature both options. Some games have their locking roles reversed, with soft dropping making the pieces drop faster and locking down, and hard dropping making the pieces drop instantly but not lock.\n","Single direction rotation is an older restriction that has since been ruled out in nearly every new official release by the favor of separate buttons for clockwise and one for counter clockwise rotation. In traditional games, the unsymmetrical vertical orientation I-, Z-, and S-pieces will fill the same columns for each clockwise and counter clockwise rotation. Some games vary this by allowing two possible column orientations: one for counter clockwise and one for clockwise rotations. Double rotation\u2014only seen in progressive clones such as \"Quadra\" and \"DTET\"\u2014rotates the piece 180\u00b0.\n","One of the features most appreciated by skilled players is \"wall kick\" or the ability to rotate the pieces even if these touch the left or right walls. In the NES version, for example, if a Z piece is \"vertically\" aligned and falling touching the left wall, the player cannot rotate the piece, giving the impression that the rotate buttons are locked. In this situation, the player has to move the piece one position to the right before rotating it, losing precious time. Proper implementations of wall kick first appeared in the arcade version of \"Tetris\" by Atari Games.\n","Piece preview allows a look at the next piece to enter the field. This feature has been implemented since the earliest games, though in those early games, having the preview turned on made the score increase more slowly.\n","Section::::Variants.\n","Several \"Tetris\" variants exist. Some feature alternate rules and pieces, some feature alternate topologies or dimensions, and others have completely different gameplay.\n","A popular variant called \"The Grand Master\" eventually becomes so fast players have to use every second of time optimally, and it even has a mode dubbed \"Invisible Tetris\", where the blocks are only shown when falling \u2013 revealed when the game is over.\n","Because of its popularity and the relatively simple code required to produce the game, a game with nearly the same rules as \"Tetris\" is often used as a hello world project for programmers coding for a new system or programming language. This has resulted in the availability of a large number of ports for different platforms.\n","For instance, \u00b5Torrent and GNU Emacs contain similar shape-stacking games as easter eggs.\n","Section::::End of play.\n","Players lose a typical game of \"Tetris\" when they can no longer keep up with the increasing speed, or when the player can not find an appropriate solution to the Tetriminos they've been given, and the Tetriminos stack up to the top of the playing field. This is commonly referred to as \"\"topping out\".\"\n","Section::::End of play.:Infinite gameplay impossibility.\n","The question \"Would it be possible to play forever?\" was first encountered in a thesis by John Brzustowski in 1992. The conclusion reached was that the game is statistically doomed to end. The reason has to do with the S and Z Tetriminos. If a player receives a sufficiently large sequence of alternating S and Z Tetriminos, the na\u00efve gravity used by the standard game eventually forces the player to leave holes on the board. The holes will necessarily stack to the top and, ultimately, end the game. If the pieces are distributed randomly, this sequence will eventually occur. Thus, if a game with, for example, an ideal, uniform, uncorrelated random number generator is played long enough, any player will top out.\n","In practice, this does not occur in most \"Tetris\" variants. Some variants allow the player to choose to play with only S and Z Tetriminos, and a good player may survive well over 150 consecutive Tetriminos this way. On an implementation with an ideal uniform randomizer, the probability at any given time of the next 150 Tetriminos being only S and Z is () (approximately ). Most implementations use a pseudorandom number generator to generate the sequence of Tetriminos, and such an S\u2013Z sequence is almost certainly not contained in the sequence produced by the 32-bit linear congruential generator in many implementations (which has roughly states). The \"evil\" algorithm in \"Bastet\" (an unofficial variant) often starts a game with a series of more than seven Z pieces.\n","Modern versions of \"Tetris\" released after 2001 use a bag-style randomizer that guarantees players will never receive more than four S or Z pieces in a row. This is one of the \"Indispensable Rules\" enforced by the \"Tetris Guideline\" that all officially licensed \"Tetris\" games must follow.\n","Recent versions of \"Tetris\" such as \"Tetris Worlds\" allow the player to repeatedly rotate a block once it hits the bottom of the playfield, without it locking into place (see Easy spin dispute, above). This permits a player to play for an infinite amount of time, though not necessarily to land an infinite number of blocks.\n","Section::::Computational complexity.\n","In computer science, it is common to analyze the computational complexity of problems, including real life problems and games. It was proven that for the \"offline\" version of \"Tetris\" (the player knows the complete sequence of pieces that will be dropped, i.e. there is no hidden information) the following objectives are NP-complete:\n","BULLET::::- Maximizing the number of rows cleared while playing the given piece sequence.\n","BULLET::::- Maximizing the number of pieces placed before a loss occurs.\n","BULLET::::- Maximizing the number of simultaneous clearing of four rows.\n","BULLET::::- Minimizing the height of the highest filled grid square over the course of the sequence.\n","Also, it is difficult to even approximately solve the first, second, and fourth problem. It is NP-hard, given an initial gameboard and a sequence of \"p\" pieces, to approximate the first two problems to within a factor of for any constant .\n","It is NP-hard to approximate the last problem within a factor of for any constant .\n","To prove NP-completeness, it was shown that there is a polynomial reduction between the 3-partition problem, which is also NP-complete, and the \"Tetris\" problem.\n","Section::::Music.\n","Section::::Music.:Game Boy version.\n","BULLET::::- Music A has become a well-known song in its own right, to the point that Level 20 in \"Tetris DS\" is based on this Game Boy version of \"Tetris\" and uses that theme. It is an instrumental arrangement of a Russian folk tune called \"Korobeiniki\", which has been covered by UK dance band Doctor Spin, US alternative rock band Ozma, Tokyo Ska Paradise Orchestra, Basshunter, Doctor P, and the German techno group Scooter on their 2007 album \"Jumping All Over the World\". It was also sampled in \"21 Concepts\" by MC Lars. Music A and B are also remixed and arranged for \"Super Smash Bros. Brawl\", and can be selected for the stage \"Luigi's Mansion\", as well as being used in custom stages. The remixes were brought back in \"Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS\" and \"Wii U\", Music A playing in \"Luigi's Mansion\" and custom stages in the Wii U version and being one of the bonus songs to play in the 3DS exclusive \"Smash Run\" mode, and Music B playing in \"Wuhu Island\" from \"Wii Sports Resort\" and in custom stages, Music A and B yet again were brought back for \"Super Smash Bros. Ultimate\" and can be played on the stages \"Summit\" from \"Ice Climber\", \"Hanenbow\" from \"Electroplankton\", \"Balloon Fight\", \"Living Room\" from \"Nintendogs\", \"Find Mii\", \"Tomodachi Life\", \"PictoChat 2\", \"Duck Hunt\", \"Wrecking Crew\", \"Pilotwings\", Wuhu Island and custom stages. The song has also been remixed for two dance games, under the name \"Pumptris Quattro\" in \"Pump It Up NX2\" and \"Happy-hopper\" in \"Dance Maniax 2nd Mix\". Ronan Murray has recorded an arrangement of the tune for pipe organ. The A theme was adapted by Australian musical group Flap!, with original lyrics added, on their debut album \"Flap!\".\n","BULLET::::- Music B is an original track by Hirokazu Tanaka, the game's sound designer.\n","BULLET::::- Music C is an arrangement of Johann Sebastian Bach's French Suite No. 3 In B Minor, BWV 814, IV. Menuett \u2013 Trio.\n","Section::::Music.:Nintendo Entertainment System version.\n","BULLET::::- Music 1 in Nintendo's NES version is \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\", a tune noted to be scene 14c of act two of \"The Nutcracker\", composed by Tchaikovsky.\n","BULLET::::- One song in the BPS and Tengen versions is the \"Kalinka\" (or Karinka, as referred in-game), a famous Russian song written by Ivan Petrovich Larionov.\n","BULLET::::- The victory song playing while the rocket blasts off is George's Bizet's \"Les Toreadors\" from \"Carmen\" Suite No. 1.\n","Section::::Music.:Atari version.\n","Atari's arcade version of \"Tetris\", and its NES port by subsidiary Tengen have original pieces composed by Brad Fuller, as well as traditional Russian tunes also arranged by Fuller.\n","Section::::Cognitive effects.\n","According to research from Dr. Richard Haier, \"et al.\" prolonged \"Tetris\" activity can also lead to more efficient brain activity during play. When first playing \"Tetris\", brain function and activity increases, along with greater cerebral energy consumption, measured by glucose metabolic rate. As \"Tetris\" players become more proficient, their brains show a reduced consumption of glucose, indicating more efficient brain activity for this task. Moderate play of \"Tetris\" (half-an-hour a day for three months) boosts general cognitive functions such as \"critical thinking, reasoning, language and processing\" and increases cerebral cortex thickness.\n","In January 2009, an Oxford University research group headed by Dr. Emily Holmes reported in \"PLoS ONE\" that for healthy volunteers, playing \"Tetris\" soon after viewing traumatic material in the laboratory reduced the number of flashbacks to those scenes in the following week. They believe that the computer game may disrupt the memories that are retained of the sights and sounds witnessed at the time, and which are later re-experienced through involuntary, distressing flashbacks of that moment. The group hopes to develop this approach further as a potential intervention to reduce the flashbacks experienced in post-traumatic stress disorder but emphasized that these are only preliminary results.\n","Professor Jackie Andrade and Jon May, from Plymouth University's Cognition Institute, and Ph.D. student Jessica Skorka-Brown have conducted research that shows that playing \"Tetris\" could give a \"quick and manageable\" fix for people struggling to stick to diets, or quit smoking or drinking.\n","Another notable effect is that, according to a Canadian study in April 2013, playing \"Tetris\" has been found to treat older adolescents with amblyopia (lazy eye), which was better than patching a victim's well eye to train their weaker eye. Dr. Robert Hess of the research team said: \"It's much better than patching \u2013 much more enjoyable; it's faster, and it seems to work better.\". Tested in the United Kingdom, this experiment also appears to help children with that problem.\n","The game has been noted to cause the brain to involuntarily picture \"Tetris\" combinations even when the player is not playing (the \"Tetris\" effect), although this can occur with any computer game or situation showcasing repeated images or scenarios, such as a jigsaw puzzle. While debates about Tetris's cognitive benefits continue, at least some researchers view it as a milestone in the gamification of education.\n","Section::::Hasbro Games.\n","In 2013, The Tetris Company signed a contract with Hasbro to make a Bop It and a Jenga themed version of \"Tetris\". The games were shown at the New York Toy Fair and Bop It Tetris was sold on Amazon.com in June 2013.\n","Jenga Tetris is like Jenga but using \"Tetris\" shapes.\n","Bop It Tetris is an audio game. It has several game modes including \"Marathon\" and \"Pass It\". In the Marathon Mode, the player has four lives and has to complete the puzzles with the square lights. The game unit has three actions which are: \"Slam It\" which slams the top part of the device down, \"Slide it\", a screen which can rotate from left and right, and \"Spin It\", where the device can spin. If the player fails to complete the puzzle, the voice of Buddy Rubino will make a Santa Claus type laugh and will encourage the player with a comment such as: \"Squares man! They're just squares!\" or \"Shapes are hard!\" and Buddy will then say \"Life lost\" and one of the four squares on the top screen will disappear. After every stage is completed Buddy will tell the player with a comment such as: \"Level up!\" and there will then be a 45-second bonus round which the player can score two or more bonus points.\n","In the Pass It Mode, it is the same as the Marathon mode except Buddy Rubino will say \"Pass It\" to let other people join in.\n","Section::::Reception and Legacy.\n","\"Compute!\" called the IBM version of \"Tetris\" \"one of the most addictive computer games this side of the Berlin Wall ... [it] is \"not\" the game to start if you have work to do or an appointment to keep. Consider yourself warned\". Orson Scott Card joked that the game \"proves that Russia still wants to bury us. I shudder to think of the blow to our economy as computer productivity drops to 0\". Noting that \"Tetris\" was not copy-protected, he wrote \"Obviously, the game is meant to find its way onto every American machine\". The IBM version of the game was reviewed in 1988 in \"Dragon\" No. 135 by Hartley, Patricia, and Kirk Lesser in \"The Role of Computers\" column. The reviewers gave the game 4.5 out of 5 stars. The Lessers later reviewed Spectrum HoloByte's Macintosh version of \"Tetris\" in 1989 in \"Dragon\" No. 141, giving that version 5 out of 5 stars. In 1993, the ZX Spectrum version of the game was voted number 49 in the \"Your Sinclair Official Top 100 Games of All Time\". In 1996, \"Tetris Pro\" was ranked the 38th best game of all time by \"Amiga Power\". \"Entertainment Weekly\" picked the game as the #8 greatest game available in 1991, saying: \"Thanks to Nintendo\u2019s endless promotion, Tetris has become one of the most popular video games.\"\n","\"Computer Gaming World\" gave \"Tetris\" the 1989 Compute! Choice Award for Arcade Game, describing it as \"by far, the most addictive game ever\". The game won three Software Publishers Association Excellence in Software Awards in 1989, including Best Entertainment Program and the Critic's Choice Award for consumers. \"Computer Gaming World\" in 1996 ranked it 14th on the magazine's list of the most innovative computer games. That same year, \"Next Generation\" listed it as number 2 on their \"Top 100 Games of All Time\", commenting that, \"There is something so perfect, so Zen about the falling blocks of \"Tetris\" that the game has captured the interest of everyone who has ever played it.\" On March 12, 2007, \"The New York Times\" reported that \"Tetris\" was named to a list of the ten most important video games of all time, the so-called game canon. After announced at the 2007 Game Developers Conference, the Library of Congress took up the video game preservation proposal and began with these 10 games, including \"Tetris\".\n","In 2007, video game website GameFAQs hosted its sixth annual \"Character Battle\", in which the users nominate their favorite video game characters for a popularity contest in which characters participate. The L-shaped \"Tetris\" piece (or \"L-Block\" as it was called) entered the contest as a joke character, but on November 4, 2007, it won the contest. On June 6, 2009, Google honored \"Tetris\" 25-year anniversary by changing its logotype to a version drawn with \"Tetris\" blocks \u2013 the \"l\" letter being the long \"Tetris\" block lowering into its place, seen here. In 2009, \"Game Informer\" put \"Tetris\" 3rd on their list of \"The Top 200 Games of All Time\", saying that \"If a game could be considered ageless, it's \"Tetris\"\". The \"Game Informer\" staff also placed it third on their 2001 list of the 100 best games ever.\n","\"Electronic Gaming Monthly\"s 100th issue had \"Tetris\" as first place in the \"Greatest Game of All Time\". In 2007, \"Tetris\" came in second place in IGN's \"100 Greatest Video Games of All Time\". In January 2010, it was announced that the \"Tetris\" franchise had sold more than 170 million copies, approximately 70 million physical copies and over 100 million copies for cell phones, making it the best-selling paid-downloaded game of all time. In 1991, \"PC Format\" named \"Tetris\" one of the 50 best computer games ever.

He is best known for his vlogs, where he posts updates about his life. His vlogging channel, \"RomanAtwoodVlogs\", has a total of 5 billion views and 15 million subscribers. The channel is currently the 50th most subscribed channel on YouTube. He also has another YouTube channel called \"RomanAtwood\", where he posts pranks but he has been inactive on it for almost 2 years. His prank videos have gained over 1.4 billion views and 10.4 million subscribers. Both of these channels are in the top 100 most subscribed on YouTube, and he became the second YouTuber after Germ\u00e1n Garmendia to receive two Diamond Play Buttons for his two channels.\n","Section::::Personal life.\n","Born in Millersport, Ohio, Atwood has been filming and producing videos since high school. He was born to Curt Dale Atwood and Susan Atwood. He began his independent career by producing a series of DVDs called \"The Nerd Herd\" which he sold at the Warped Tour in 2006. Atwood has also worked on various film projects and commercials in Columbus, Ohio until 2010, when he decided to focus on his passion of comedy and created the YouTube channel \"Sketch Empire\".\n","Prior to his YouTube career, he worked at his family's rope factory called \"Atwood Rope\". In 2001, he married Shanna Riley, who gave birth to Atwood's first son, Noah Vaughn Atwood (born October 18, 2004). In 2008, after his wife cheated on him with a friend while on vacation, he filed for a divorce.\n","In 2013, Atwood founded his own merchandise line called \"Smile More\", selling T-shirts, hoodies, bracelets and other items.\n","He currently resides in his hometown with his wife Brittney Smith-Atwood, with whom he has a second son, Kane Alexander Atwood (born October 23, 2011) and daughter, Cora Atwood (born July 16, 2017). Atwood met Smith at the wedding of his friend, Chase Gilroy, where Roman was his best man in 2008. Smith is the sister of Gilroy's wife, Veronica, and the two started dating from there. Atwood proposed to Smith on April 30, 2018, and the two married on July 27, 2018, in Maui, Hawaii.\n","On May 29, 2019, Atwood's mother, Susan Atwood, died unexpectedly after a tragic accident while on vacation with the entire Atwood family. Atwood subsequently took time out from his social media activity to grieve for his mother.\n","Section::::Career.\n","Section::::Career.:YouTube.\n","Section::::Career.:YouTube.:Plastic Ball Prank.\n","In this video, Atwood fills his house with plastic balls 2.5\u00a0ft high, turning it into a massive ball pit. This video was uploaded on January 18, 2015, and currently has almost 86 million views. This video was noticed by Nissan, who gave him a 2015 Nissan GTR in exchange to use his video in the \"WithDad\" campaign during their half-time advert at Super Bowl XLIX. This was awarded the best \"Brand Campaign\" for the 5th Streamy Awards.\n","Section::::Career.:YouTube.:Anniversary Prank.\n","His video \"Anniversary Prank Backfires!!\" was posted on November 20, 2013, and currently has over 86 million views. It features Atwood pranking Smith on their five-year dating anniversary by confessing that he has cheated on her. The prank backfires when she sees the camera beforehand and pranks him back by pretending that she has cheated on him too. She only reveals her own prank after a few seconds of Atwood reacting badly to the news. At the end of the video, Smith says \"I thought you were going to propose\".\n","Section::::Career.:YouTube.:Killing My Kid Prank.\n","A prank titled \"Killing My Own Kid PRANK!!\", posted on November 30, 2014, and currently has over 50 million views. The video shows Atwood pranking Smith by throwing a mannequin in a Spider-Man costume, pretending it was their son Kane. When Smith runs to the mannequin, she quickly pulls off its mask, realizing it was not Kane, and in fact the mannequin. At this point, she breaks down into tears as Atwood enters the room snickering at her. She then storms off, but returns when Atwood asks her \"Are you really that mad?\" She then starts shouting at him and tells him he's \"sleeping on the couch\". The prank was referenced during Atwood and Smith's appearance on the reality TV series \"Tanked\", where Smith revealed that Atwood did in fact sleep on the couch that night.\n","Section::::Career.:Film.\n","Section::::Career.:Film.:\"Natural Born Pranksters\".\n","In 2016, Atwood, Vitaly Zdorovetskiy and Dennis Roady released a film produced by Lionsgate, called \"Natural Born Pranksters\" which has received generally negative reviews.

On IMDb, the movie has an average rating of 3.7 out of 10 stars.\n","Section::::Career.:Tour.\n","In 2016, Atwood and fellow YouTuber Yousef Erakat started a worldwide tour called \"Roman vs. Fousey\".

The second season, titled \"Stranger Things 2\", is set one year later in October 1984 and deals with the characters' attempts to return to normality and the aftermath of the events from the first season. The third season, titled \"Stranger Things 3\", is set in July 1985.\n","The Duffer Brothers developed the series as a mix of investigative drama alongside supernatural elements portrayed with childlike sensibilities. They set the series in the 1980s and created an homage to the pop culture of that decade. Several themes and directorial aspects were inspired and aesthetically informed by the works of Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, and Stephen King, among others, including several films, anime, and video games.\n","The first season of eight episodes premiered on Netflix on July 15, 2016. It received critical acclaim for its characterization, pacing, atmosphere, acting, soundtrack, directing, writing, and homages to 1980s genre films. The second season consisting of nine episodes was released on October 27, 2017. A third season consisting of eight episodes was released on July 4, 2019. The Duffer Brothers have said that \"Stranger Things\" is likely to end after its fourth or fifth season. The series has received 31 Emmy Award nominations, including for Outstanding Drama Series, and four Golden Globe Award nominations, and it won the Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series in 2016. \n","Section::::Premise.\n","\"Stranger Things\" is set in the fictional rural town of Hawkins, Indiana, during the early 1980s. The nearby Hawkins National Laboratory ostensibly performs scientific research for the United States Department of Energy, but secretly does experiments into the paranormal and supernatural, including those that involve human test subjects. Inadvertently, they have created a portal to an alternate dimension, \"the Upside Down\". The influence of the Upside Down starts to affect the unknowing residents of Hawkins in calamitous ways.\n","The first season begins in November 1983, when Will Byers is abducted by a creature from the Upside Down. His mother, Joyce, and the town's police chief, Jim Hopper, search for Will. At the same time, a young psychokinetic girl called Eleven escapes from the laboratory and assists Will's friends, Mike, Dustin, and Lucas, in their own efforts to find Will.\n","The second season is set a year later, starting in October 1984. Will has been rescued, but few know of the details of the events. When it is discovered that Will is still being influenced by entities from the Upside Down, his friends and family learn there is a larger threat to their universe from the Upside Down.\n","The third season is set a few months later, in the days leading up to the Fourth of July celebration in 1985. The new Starcourt Mall has become the center of attention for Hawkins' residents, putting most other stores out of business. Hopper becomes increasingly concerned about Eleven and Mike's relationship while still trying to care for Joyce.

The two had completed writing and producing their 2015 film \"Hidden\", which they had tried to emulate the style of M. Night Shyamalan. However, due to changes at Warner Bros., its distributor, the film did not see a wide release and the Duffer Brothers were unsure of their future. To their surprise, television producer Donald De Line approached them, impressed with \"Hidden\"s script, and offered them the opportunity to work on episodes of \"Wayward Pines\" alongside Shyamalan. The brothers were mentored by Shyamalan during the episode's production, so that when they finished, they felt they were ready to produce their own television series.\n","The Duffer Brothers prepared a script that would essentially be similar to the series' actual pilot episode, along with a 20-page pitch book to help shop the series around for a network. They pitched the story to about fifteen cable networks, all of which rejected the script on the basis that they felt a plot centered around children as leading characters would not work, asking them to make it a children's series or to drop the children and focus on Hopper's investigation in the paranormal. In early 2015, Dan Cohen, the VP of 21 Laps Entertainment, brought the script to his colleague Shawn Levy. They subsequently invited the Duffer Brothers to their office and purchased the rights for the series, giving full authorship of it to the brothers. After reading the pilot, the streaming service Netflix purchased the whole season for an undisclosed amount; the series was subsequently announced for a planned 2016 release by Netflix in early April 2015. The Duffer Brothers stated that at the time they had pitched to Netflix, the service had already gotten recognized for its original programming, such as \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange Is the New Black\", with well-recognized producers behind them, and were ready to start giving upcoming producers like them a chance. The brothers started to write out the series and brought Levy and Cohen in as executive producers to start casting and filming.\n","The series was originally known as \"Montauk\". The setting was then Montauk, New York and nearby Long Island locations. Montauk figured into a number of real world conspiracy theories involving secret government experiments. The brothers had chosen Montauk as it had further Spielberg ties with the film \"Jaws\", where Montauk was used for the fictional setting of Amity Island. After deciding to change the narrative of the series to take place in the fictional town of Hawkins instead, the brothers felt they could now do things to the town, such as placing it under quarantine, that they really could not envision with a real location. With the change in location, they had to come up with a new title for the series under direction from Netflix's Ted Sarandos so that they could start marketing it to the public. The brothers started by using a copy of Stephen King's \"Firestarter\" novel to consider the title's font and appearance, and came up with a long list of potential alternatives. \"Stranger Things\" came about as it sounded similar to another King novel, \"Needful Things\", though Matt noted they still had a \"lot of heated arguments\" over this final title.\n","To pitch the series, the Duffer Brothers showcased images, footage and music from classic 1970s and 1980s films such as \"E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial\", \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", \"Poltergeist\", \"Hellraiser\", \"Stand by Me\", \"Firestarter\", \"A Nightmare on Elm Street\" and \"Jaws\", in order to establish the tone of the series.\n","Section::::Production.:Writing.\n","The idea of \"Stranger Things\" started with how the brothers felt they could take the concept of the 2013 film \"Prisoners\", detailing the moral struggles a father goes through when his daughter is kidnapped, and expand it out over eight or so hours in a serialized television approach. As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as Project MKUltra, which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual. This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film \"Red Dawn\" came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia. Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the series, crafting it in the realm of science fiction and horror. Other influences cited by the Duffer Brothers include: Stephen King novels; films produced by Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, Wes Craven, and Guillermo del Toro; films such as \"Star Wars\", \"Alien\", and \"Stand by Me\"; Japanese anime such as \"Akira\" and \"Elfen Lied\"; and several video games including \"Silent Hill\", \"Dark Souls\" and \"The Last of Us\". The Duffer Brothers also believe that they may have brought influences from other works unintentionally, including \"Beyond the Black Rainbow\" and \"D.A.R.Y.L.\", discovered by reviewing fan feedback on the series. Several websites and publications have found other pop culture references in the series, particularly references to 1980s pop culture.\n","With Netflix as the platform, the Duffer Brothers were not limited to a typical 22-episode format, opting for the eight-episode approach. They had been concerned that a 22-episode season on broadcast television would be difficult to \"tell a cinematic story\" with that many episodes. Eight episodes allowed them to give time to characterization in addition to narrative development; if they had less time available, they would have had to remain committed to telling a horror film as soon as the monster was introduced and abandon the characterization. Within the eight episodes, the brothers aimed to make the first season \"feel like a big movie\" with all the major plot lines completed so that \"the audience feels satisfied\", but left enough unresolved to indicate \"there's a bigger mythology, and there's a lot of dangling threads at the end\", something that could be explored in further seasons if Netflix opted to create more.\n","Regarding writing for the children characters of the series, the Duffer Brothers considered themselves as outcasts from other students while in high school and thus found it easy to write for Mike and his friends, and particularly for Barb. Joyce was fashioned after Richard Dreyfuss' character Roy Neary in \"Close Encounters of the Third Kind\", as she appears \"absolutely bonkers\" to everyone else as she tries to find Will.\n","Section::::Production.:Casting.\n","In June 2015, it was announced that Winona Ryder and David Harbour had joined the series as Joyce and as the unnamed chief of police, respectively. The brothers' casting director Carmen Cuba had suggested Ryder for the role of Joyce, which the two were immediately drawn to because of her predominance in the films of the 1980s. Levy believed Ryder could \"wretch up the emotional urgency and yet find layers and nuance and different sides of [Joyce]\". Ryder praised that the show's multiple storylines required her to act for Joyce as \"she's out of her mind, but she's actually kind of onto something\", and that the producers had faith she could pull off the difficult role. The Duffer Brothers had been interested in Harbour before, who until \"Stranger Things\" primarily had smaller roles as villainous characters, and they felt that he had been \"waiting too long for this opportunity\" to play a lead, while Harbour himself was thrilled by the script and the chance to play \"a broken, flawed, anti-hero character\".\n","Additional casting followed two months later with Finn Wolfhard as Mike, Millie Bobby Brown in an undisclosed role, Gaten Matarazzo as Dustin, Caleb McLaughlin as Lucas, Natalia Dyer as Nancy, and Charlie Heaton as Jonathan. In September 2015, Cara Buono joined the cast as Karen, followed by Matthew Modine as Martin Brenner a month later. Additional cast who recur include Noah Schnapp as Will, Shannon Purser as Barbara \"Barb\" Holland, Joe Keery as Steve Harrington, and Ross Partridge as Lonnie, among others.\n","Actors auditioning for the children roles read lines from \"Stand By Me\". The Duffer Brothers estimated they went through about a thousand different child actors for the roles. They noted that Wolfhard was already \"a movie buff\" of the films from the 1980s period and easily filled the role, while they found Matarazzo's audition to be much more authentic than most of the other audition tapes, and selected him after a single viewing of his audition tape. As casting was started immediately after Netflix greenlit the show, and prior to the scripts being fully completed, this allowed some of the actor's takes on the roles to reflect into the script. The casting of the young actors for Will and his friends had been done just after the first script was completed, and subsequent scripts incorporated aspects from these actors. The brothers said Modine provided significant input on the character of Dr. Brenner, whom they had not really fleshed out before as they considered him the hardest character to write for given his limited appearances within the narrative.\n","Section::::Production.:Filming.\n","The brothers had desired to film the series around the Long Island area to match the initial Montauk concept. However, with filming scheduled to take place in November 2015, it was difficult to shoot in Long Island in the cold weather, and the production started scouting locations in and around the Atlanta, Georgia area. The brothers, who grew up in North Carolina, found many places that reminded them of their own childhoods in that area, and felt the area would work well with the narrative shift to the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.\n","The filming of the first season began in November 2015 and was extensively done in Atlanta, Georgia, with the Duffer Brothers and Levy handling the direction of individual episodes. Jackson served as the basis of the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana. Other shooting locations included the Georgia Mental Health Institute as the Hawkins National Laboratory site, Bellwood Quarry, Patrick Henry High School in Stockbridge, Georgia, for the middle and high school scenes, Emory University's Continuing Education Department, the former city hall in Douglasville, Georgia, the Georgia International Horse Park in Conyers, Georgia, the probate court in Butts County, Georgia, Old East Point Library and East Point First Baptist Church in East Point, Georgia, Fayetteville, Georgia, Stone Mountain Park, Palmetto, Georgia, and Winston, Georgia. Set work was done at Screen Gem Studios in Atlanta. The series was filmed with a Red Dragon digital camera. Filming for the first season concluded in early 2016.\n","Section::::Production.:Visual effects.\n","To create the aged effect for the series, a film grain was added over the footage, which was captured by scanning in film stock from the 1980s. The Duffer Brothers wanted to scare the audience, but not to necessarily make the series violent or gory, following in line with how the 1980s Amblin Entertainment films drove the creation of the PG-13 movie rating. It was \"much more about mood and atmosphere and suspense and dread than they are about gore\", though they were not afraid to push into more scary elements, particularly towards the end of the first season. The brothers had wanted to avoid any computer-generated effects for the monster and other parts of the series and stay with practical effects, so they created an animatronic to play the part of the demogorgon. However, the six-month filming time left them little time to plan out and test practical effects rigs for some of the shots. They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.\n","The title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the \"Stranger Things\" title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title. The sequence was created by the studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part of R\/GA, led by creative director Michelle Doughtey. Levy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision of the 1980s-inspired series, which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R\/GA, such as \"Altered States\" and \"The Dead Zone\". They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with ITC Benguiat, requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film \"Bullitt\", which the producers had suggested to the studio.\n","Section::::Production.:Music.\n","The \"Stranger Things\" original soundtrack was composed by Michael Stein and Kyle Dixon of the electronic band Survive. It makes extensive use of synthesizers in homage to 1980s artists and film composers including Jean-Michel Jarre, Tangerine Dream, Vangelis, Goblin, John Carpenter, Giorgio Moroder, and Fabio Frizzi.\n","According to Stein and Dixon, the Duffer Brothers had been fans of Survive's music, and used their song \"Dirge\" for the mock trailer that was used to sell the series to Netflix. The Duffer Brothers discovered the band through the 2014 film \"The Guest\", where Survive features on the soundtrack. Once the series was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music; the two provided the production team with dozens of songs from their band's past to gain their interest, helping to land them the role. Once aboard, the two worked with producers to select some of their older music to rework for the series, while developing new music, principally with character motifs. The two had been hired before the casting process, so their motif demos were used and played over the actors' audition tapes, aiding in the casting selection. The series' theme is based on an unused work Stein composed much earlier that ended up in the library of work they shared with the production staff, who thought that with some reworking would be good for the opening credits.\n","In addition to original music, \"Stranger Things\" features period music from artists including The Clash, Joy Division, Toto, New Order, The Bangles, Foreigner, Echo and the Bunnymen, Peter Gabriel, and Corey Hart, as well as excerpts from Tangerine Dream, John Carpenter, and Vangelis. In particular, The Clash's \"Should I Stay or Should I Go\" was specifically picked to play at pivotal moments of the story, such as when Will is trying to communicate with Joyce from the Upside Down.\n","Section::::Release.\n","The first season consisted of eight one-hour-long episodes which were released worldwide on Netflix on July 15, 2016, in Ultra HD 4K. The second season, consisting of nine episodes, was released on October 27, 2017 in HDR. The third season once again consists of eight episodes, and was released on July 4, 2019.\n","Section::::Release.:Home media.\n","The first season of \"Stranger Things\" was released on a Blu-ray\/DVD combo pack exclusively to Target retailers on October 17, 2017, and the same for the 4K\/Blu-ray combo pack on November 15, 2017, both of which includes vintage CBS-FOX VHS-inspired packaging. The second season received a similar release on November 6, 2018.\n","Section::::Reception.\n","Section::::Reception.:Audience viewership.\n","Netflix did not initially reveal subscriber viewership numbers for their original series, and Symphony Technology Group compiled data for the season based on people using software on their phones that measures television viewing by detecting a program's sound. According to Symphony, within the first 35 days of release, \"Stranger Things\" averaged ratings around 14.07 million adults between the ages 18\u201349 in the United States. This made it the third most-watched season of Netflix original content in the U.S. at the time behind the first season of \"Fuller House\" and fourth season of \"Orange Is the New Black\". In a September 2016 analysis, Netflix found that \"Stranger Things\" \"hooked\" viewers by the second episode of the first season, indicating that the second episode was \"the first installment that led at least 70 percent of viewers who watched that episode to complete the entire first season of a show.\"\n","For the third season, Netflix revealed that the show had broken viewing records for Netflix, with 40.7 million households having watched the show in its first four days, and 18.2 million already watched the entire series within that timeframe.\n","Section::::Reception.:Critical response.\n","Review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes gave the first season an approval rating of 96% based on 84 reviews, and a weighted average rating of 8.17\/10.

It was also included on \"The Atlantic\"'s best TV show of 2017 list.\n","Section::::Reception.:Commentary.\n","\"Stranger Things\" gained a dedicated fan base soon after its release. One area of focus was the character of Barb, Nancy's nerdy friend and classmate who is taken and killed by the monster early in the season. According to actress Shannon Purser, Barb \"wasn't supposed to be a big deal\", and the Duffer Brothers had not gone into great detail about the character since the focus was on finding Will. However, many fans sympathized with the character; Laura Bradley of \"Vanity Fair\" suggested that Barb would be a similar misfit in society, and \"looks more like someone you might actually meet in real life\" compared to the other characters, particularly Nancy. Hashtags grew in popularity after the series' release, such as \"#ImWithBarb\" and \"#JusticeforBarb\", and several fan sites and forums were created to support her. Purser did not return for the second season, but the Duffer Brothers used the real-life \"Justice for Barb\" movement as inspiration for narrative at the start of the second season: Nancy addresses the fact \"that no one ever cares about\" Barb. Purser and several media outlets took her nomination as Barb for Outstanding Guest Actress in a Drama Series in the Primetime Emmy Awards as achieving \"Justice for Barb\", highlighting how well her character was received.\n","Another impact of the series has been an increased demand for Eggo waffles, as they are shown to be Eleven's favorite food in several episodes and are seen as a representation of the series. The Kellogg Company manufactures Eggo and had not been part of the production prior to the first season's release, but they recognized the market impact of the series. They provided a vintage 1980s Eggo television advertisement for Netflix to use in its Super Bowl LI commercial, and they intend to become more involved with cross-promotion. Coca-Cola will have a limited run of New Coke (introduced in 1985) to coincide with the third season of the show, which takes place in 1985.\n","Section::::Reception.:Legal matters.\n","In April 2018, filmmaker Charlie Kessler filed a lawsuit against the Duffer brothers, claiming that they stole his idea behind his short film \"Montauk\", which featured a similar premise of a missing boy, a nearby military base doing otherworldy experiments, and a monster from another dimension. Kessler directed the film and debuted it at the 2012 Hamptons International Film Festival. During the 2014 Tribeca Film Festival, he pitched his film to the Duffer brothers and later gave them \"the script, ideas, story and film\" for a larger film idea which he called \"The Montauk Project\". Kessler contended that the Duffer brothers used his ideas to devise the premise for \"Stranger Things\" and sought a third of the income that they had made from the series. The Duffer brothers' lawyer stated that they never saw Kessler's film nor spoke to him regarding it, and that Kessler had no input into their concepts for \"Stranger Things\". The judge denied summary judgment for the Duffer brothers in April 2019, allowing Kessler's suit to proceed to trial. Just before the trial was due to start in May 2019, Kessler withdrew his lawsuit after hearing the depositions and seeing documents from as early as 2010 which showed him that the Duffers had independently come up with the concept of \"Stranger Things\".\n","Journalists have noted that the idea of supernatural events around Montauk had originated due to urban legend of the Montauk Project, which came to light from the 1992 book \"\".\n","In September 2017, multiple media outlets published articles about a cease-and-desist letter sent by a Netflix in-house attorney to the operator of a \"Stranger-Things\"-themed bar in Chicago. The letter included humorous references to the series: \"unless I'm living in the Upside Down\"; \"we're not going to go full Dr. Brenner on you\"; \"the demogorgon is not always as forgiving\". The letter also won praise from lawyers for its even-handedness in not demanding immediate closure of the bar, only demanding that the bar not remain open without Netflix's permission past its initial scheduled run.\n","Section::::Reception.:Awards and nominations.\n","\"Stranger Things\" has received numerous awards and nominations across the entertainment industry, including ten Primetime Emmy Award nominations and four Golden Globe Award nominations through the second season.

It was written by Jody Houser and illustrated by Ibrahim Moustafa.\n","The second \"Stranger Things\" title is another four-part miniseries, written again by Jody Houser with interior art by Edgar Salazar, titled \"Stranger Things: Six\". The comic focuses on one of the experiments preceding Eleven: a girl named Francine, who possesses powers of precognition. The first issue went on sale on May 29.\n","Section::::Other media.:\"Dungeons & Dragons\" game.\n","Hasbro published a licensed version of a \"Stranger Things\"-themed \"Dungeons & Dragons\" starter kit in May 2019. The kit, besides including instruction books, character sheets and dice, included a campaign \"The Hunt for the Thessalhydra\" which the children played in the first season (written with the intent of having come from the pen of the character of Will himself) as well as Demogorgon minifigs.\n","Section::::Other media.:Video games.\n","Section::::Other media.:Video games.:Mobile games.\n","Netflix and BonusXP developed a free mobile game tie-in for \"Stranger Things\", released to iOS and Android devices on October 4, 2017. The game uses a retro-pixel style of art, similar to games for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game is loosely based on the \"Stranger Things\" story after season one, with the player starting as Chief of Police Jim Hopper looking for the missing boys. Once these characters are found, they become playable and have special abilities that allow the player to access more areas in the game. BonusXP had less than a year to complete the game. The team decided to make the game in a similar style to \"The Legend of Zelda\" because it \"was a perfect match because both [\"Stranger Things\" and \"Zelda\"] are about exploration, and it's kind of a mysterious fit that fit the mood of the show,\" according to BonusXP president Dave Pottinger. The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed. In order to help keep the game a secret, BonusXP did not hire game testers for their quality assurance, instead having family members from the design team provide feedback; this process helped create the two difficulty levels in the game. Completing the game gives players a clip from the first episode of the second season of the series. The game was downloaded 3 million times in the first week, becoming a top download and receiving critical praise. With the release of season two, an update to the game added Max as a playable character, and a release for the Amazon Fire TV, which included controller support. The game was nominated for \"Mobile Game\" at the 14th British Academy Games Awards.\n","A second mobile game by BonusXP, \"Stranger Things 3: The Game\", was announced during The Game Awards 2018. It will be released as a tie-in for \"Stranger Things\" third season, launching on July 4, 2019. This game will be an isometric action game, where players leads selected show characters, including Joyce, Jim, Max, and Eleven, through various levels, with gameplay inspired by several video games of the 1980s. The game will follow the narrative of the third season, as BonusXP had some input with the Duffer brothers, and will provide additional story elements that the show does not have time to explore.\n","A third mobile game, simply called \"Stranger Things\", is being developed by Next Games. It will be location-based game with role-playing game mechanics.\n","Section::::Other media.:Video games.:PlayStation VR game.\n","Sony Interactive Entertainment has announced that it is working on a PlayStation 4-exclusive game, based on \"Stranger Things\", for their PlayStation VR peripheral. The company has since released a teaser showing the Christmas-lights-on-a-wall scenes.\n","Section::::Other media.:Video games.:Cancelled Telltale game.\n","In June 2018, Netflix announced plans for Telltale Games to produce an episodic adventure game based on the series, as part of a larger partnership that would see ports of other Telltale series as interactive movies on Netflix. However, the project was cancelled after Telltale laid off the majority of its staff in September 2018. As planned, the game would have taken place in the springtime of 1985, bridging the events of the second and third season. Telltale had also commissioned a companion game from Night School Studio that would be a precursor to their title, but this also was canned on Telltale's closure.\n","Section::::Other media.:Others.\n","Lego introduced a \"Stranger Things\" set called \"The Upside Down\", based on a version of the Byers' home and its replica in the Upside Down, in May 2019. Netflix partnered with Epic Games to include some elements of \"Stranger Things\" in \"Fortnite Battle Royale\" in the weeks preceding the show's third season launch.\n","United States Representative David Cicilline compared the state of the nation during the presidency of Donald Trump to that of \"Stranger Things\" during a speech given in Congress on February 16, 2017, using a sign \"Trump Things\" in the same format as the title card of the series and saying \"Like the main characters in \"Stranger Things\", we are now stuck in the Upside Down\".\n","As part of its release on Netflix on April 14, 2017, the cast of the rebooted version of \"Mystery Science Theater 3000\" riffed on the first part of \"Chapter 1\" of \"Stranger Things\". Google used augmented reality (AR) \"stickers\" of \"Stranger Things\" characters to introduce its ARCore technology announced alongside its Pixel 2 phone in October 2017. \"Sesame Street\" created a young audience-appropriate spoof of \"Stranger Things\", called \"Sharing Things\", released in November 2017; it featured Cookie Monster as the \"Cookiegorgon\", Grover as Lucas, Ernie as Dustin, and included several nods to the narrative of the second season. \"The Simpsons\" episode \"Treehouse of Horror XXX\" to air on October 20, 2019, will include a segment parodying \"Stranger Things\". The classic 1980s bicycles used in the series have been produced in limited runs that sell out quickly.\n","Section::::External links.\n","BULLET::::- Analysis of the Duffer Brothers' \"show bible\" from Screencraft.org\n"]},"anchors":{"paragraph_id":[1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,3,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,6,6,6,6,6,7,9,11,11,12,12,13,13,14,14,14,15,15,15,15,16,16,17,17,18,18,19,19,20,20,21,21,22,22,23,23,24,24,25,25,25,26,26,27,27,28,31,31,31,31,31,31,32,32,32,32,32,32,33,33,33,33,33,33,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,38,38,40,40,41,41,41,41,41,41,41,41,41,41,41,41,42,44,45,45,45,45,45,45,45,45,45,45,45,45,45,45,45,47,47,47,47,47,48,48,48,48,48,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,50,51,51,52,52,52,52,52,52,52,52,52,52,54,54,56,56,59,59,59,59,62,62,62,62,62,62,62,62,62,65,65,65,67,68,68,68,68,68,70,70,71,74,74,74,77,77,77,80,83,83,84,86,90,90,93,93,93,93,93,93,93,93,93,94,94,95,97,97,97,99,99,99,99,101,101,101,102,102,103,103,103,103,103,103,103,103,103,103,105],"start":[31,47,54,91,123,184,233,247,262,277,297,314,332,346,362,378,399,416,533,545,563,579,643,38,241,207,331,349,369,422,433,111,204,508,546,581,628,65,185,260,275,387,209,74,12,28,12,29,12,29,12,34,81,12,31,76,114,12,32,12,28,12,30,12,26,12,30,12,28,12,26,12,25,12,32,12,26,125,12,27,12,26,30,79,161,215,262,421,543,227,532,591,799,1112,1133,67,96,163,304,871,1066,121,151,189,204,218,233,248,280,111,714,926,1152,1172,1235,1274,1292,1308,1324,1359,1372,1385,1408,1423,1435,1460,1483,1498,1515,1648,1679,267,309,36,53,50,73,116,143,170,197,244,293,375,397,439,474,59,300,182,291,364,381,410,547,574,610,649,734,755,778,799,822,921,44,287,340,603,690,239,965,986,1671,2051,110,145,214,233,250,260,268,284,305,241,790,94,105,119,125,136,149,160,183,202,314,121,130,94,228,94,552,570,588,0,18,109,279,307,327,386,537,572,60,79,113,231,62,195,445,533,570,349,403,117,112,154,298,104,124,400,0,51,70,38,0,0,67,37,91,99,151,202,644,1080,1559,1658,85,223,99,0,69,137,42,80,197,508,0,176,237,29,89,90,182,194,319,351,495,533,550,633,656,12],"end":[46,53,68,106,130,194,245,260,275,295,312,330,344,360,372,392,411,425,543,561,573,590,653,45,254,233,347,363,381,427,443,127,221,518,570,599,714,72,219,270,287,406,222,100,24,39,25,39,25,41,30,54,94,27,47,99,118,28,46,24,41,26,44,22,39,26,44,24,38,22,47,21,41,28,46,22,35,135,23,36,22,39,44,98,167,233,274,435,556,241,553,601,806,1126,1156,84,107,182,308,882,1080,147,185,200,214,229,244,273,284,120,729,934,1167,1178,1247,1290,1306,1318,1342,1368,1377,1396,1413,1428,1445,1470,1494,1508,1529,1672,1689,283,343,48,66,63,91,131,159,182,211,254,307,387,411,448,488,70,307,189,322,379,406,430,568,606,626,670,753,776,792,816,838,924,54,307,358,629,706,243,979,999,1683,2058,117,156,231,248,258,266,282,299,317,250,795,103,117,123,134,147,158,181,196,212,342,129,132,100,235,119,564,583,611,17,33,125,288,323,345,397,547,588,72,85,125,245,66,210,458,542,578,385,424,132,132,172,384,113,132,411,20,62,86,53,17,6,85,48,94,106,162,237,663,1097,1573,1691,105,232,118,30,82,151,56,94,214,527,4,186,259,44,115,118,188,211,326,364,509,539,555,645,679,57],"text":["science fiction","horror","web television","Duffer Brothers","Netflix","Shawn Levy","Winona Ryder","David Harbour","Finn Wolfhard","Millie Bobby Brown","Gaten Matarazzo","Caleb McLaughlin","Natalia Dyer","Charlie Heaton","Cara Buono","Matthew Modine","Noah Schnapp","Joe Keery","Sadie Sink","Dacre Montgomery","Sean Astin","Paul Reiser","Maya Hawke","Indiana","psychokinetic","pop culture of that decade","Steven Spielberg","John Carpenter","Stephen King","anime","video game","characterization","1980s genre films","Emmy Award","Outstanding Drama Series","Golden Globe Award","Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by an Ensemble in a Drama Series","Indiana","United States Department of Energy","paranormal","supernatural","alternate dimension","psychokinetic","Fourth of July celebration","Winona Ryder","Joyce Byers","David Harbour","Jim Hopper","Finn Wolfhard","Mike Wheeler","Millie Bobby Brown","Eleven \/ Jane Hopper","psychokinetic","Gaten Matarazzo","Dustin Henderson","cleidocranial dysplasia","lisp","Caleb McLaughlin","Lucas Sinclair","Natalia Dyer","Nancy Wheeler","Charlie Heaton","Jonathan Byers","Cara Buono","Karen Wheeler","Matthew Modine","Martin Brenner","Noah Schnapp","Will Byers","Sadie Sink","Maxine \"Max\" Mayfield","Joe Keery","Steve Harrington","Dacre Montgomery","Billy Hargrove","Sean Astin","Bob Newby","RadioShack","Paul Reiser","Sam Owens","Maya Hawke","Robin Buckley","Erica Sinclair","the Duffer Brothers","Hidden","M.

The two had previously worked together on the similarly themed series \"24\". On September 19, 2010, Showtime placed a pilot order for \"Homeland\" as the first project David Nevins had undertaken since leaving Imagine Entertainment to become president of Showtime. Gordon, Gansa and Raff wrote the pilot, Michael Cuesta directed the pilot, with Gordon, Gansa, Raff, Avi Nir, and Ran Telem serving as executive producers.\n","On April 7, 2011, Showtime green-lit the series with an order of 12 episodes. It was announced that Chip Johannessen would join the series as a co-executive producer, while Michael Cuesta, who had served as the director on the pilot, would join the series as an executive producer.\n","On July 21, 2011, at the San Diego Comic-Con, Showtime announced that the series would premiere on October 2, 2011. Along with the announcement of the premiere date for the series, the network also announced that the names of the characters portrayed by Claire Danes and Damian Lewis had been renamed Carrie Mathison and Nicholas Brody, from Carrie Anderson and Scott Brody, respectively. The series is produced by Fox 21.\n","In September 2016, Gansa announced that he would be crafting the eighth season as the series' last. He pointed out that the decision would ultimately fall on Showtime, but that he would be moving toward an eight-season close. He also stated that it would be his desire to film the final season in Israel, where \"Homeland\"s source series, \"Prisoners of War\", originated.\n","Section::::Production.:Casting.\n","Casting announcements began in November 2010, with Claire Danes first to be cast. Danes portrays Carrie Mathison, \"a driven CIA officer battling her own psychological demons.\" Next to join the series was Mandy Patinkin as Saul Berenson, \"the smart and politically savvy CIA Division Chief ... who is Carrie's main champion in the intelligence upper echelon and her sounding board.\" Laura Fraser was initially cast as Jessica Brody, \"Nick Brody's smart, strong wife.\", but after the pilot Fraser was replaced by Morena Baccarin. Next to join the series were Damian Lewis and David Harewood, with Lewis playing Brody, \"who returns home after spending eight years as a prisoner of war in Baghdad\", while Harewood was cast as David Estes, \"a rising star in the CIA, Carrie's boss ... is the youngest director of the Counterterrorism Center in the Agency's history.\" Diego Klattenhoff, Morgan Saylor, and Jackson Pace were the last actors to join the main cast, with Klattenhoff playing Mike Faber, \"Brody's close friend and fellow Marine, Mike Faber was convinced that Brody was dead, which is how he justified falling in love with Brody's wife Jessica\", Saylor playing Dana Brody, \"The Brodys' oldest child\", and Pace playing Chris Brody, \"Nick and Jessica's eager-to-please, self-conscious thirteen year-old son.\"\n","It was later announced that Jamey Sheridan, Navid Negahban, Amir Arison, and Brianna Brown had joined the series as recurring guest stars. Sheridan was cast as the Vice President of the United States, Negahban was cast as Abu Nazir, with Arison playing Prince Farid Bin Abbud and Brown playing Lynne Reed.\n","Section::::Production.:Filming.\n","The series is filmed in and around Charlotte, North Carolina. The location was chosen because of film tax credits, and the atmosphere matches nearby Virginia and Washington, D.C., where the series is set. Production claims it is easier to get around the area's smaller city atmosphere rather than in large cities where filming typically occurs. Another frequent setting is nearby Mooresville. Executive producer Michael Cuesta said Mooresville is \"played for quite a few rural-type one-stoplight main-street type of towns.\"\n","The Brody family house is in Mountainbrook, a Charlotte neighborhood near SouthPark Mall. Queens University of Charlotte is the Brody daughter's college. CIA headquarters is Cambridge Corporate Center in University Research Park. Charlotte\/Douglas International Airport, the Ritz-Carlton, the old courthouse, Ed's Tavern, and Zack's Hamburgers in Charlotte, as well as Rural Hill in Huntersville and Lake Norman, have also served as filming locations.\n","Production for season two began in May 2012 with the series filming in Israel for two weeks, with Israeli cities standing in for Beirut. The rest of the season was filmed in Charlotte and Concord, North Carolina.\n","Production for the third season began in late May 2013, continuing production in Raleigh, North Carolina. The series also filmed in Old San Juan, Puerto Rico, which stood in for Caracas, Venezuela. The series was also planning on returning to Israel for additional filming, but filming moved to Morocco, due to ongoing conflicts in Syria.\n","Production for the fourth season took place from June through November 2014 in Cape Town, South Africa, while the fifth season moved production to Berlin, Germany.\n","The sixth season began production in August 2016 and filmed in New York City and Morocco. The seventh season began production on September 11, 2017, and primarily filmed in Richmond, Virginia. Additional filming for season seven occurred in Budapest, Hungary, for episodes 11 and 12.\n","Section::::Production.:Other media.\n","Since the conclusion of season 2, several pieces of in-universe material have been published. \n","BULLET::::- HomelandAftermath.com provides a deeper look into the aftermath of season 2, with news reports and survivors' accounts.\n","BULLET::::- Twentieth Century Fox partnered with Audible.com to offer \"Phantom Pain \u2013 A Homeland Story\" (2014), a 30-minute audio piece narrated by Damian Lewis, which details Brody's movements between seasons 2 and 3 of the show.\n","BULLET::::- \"Homeland: Carrie's Run\" (2013) is a novel that tells the story of Carrie Mathison in a series of events that take place before season 1.\n","BULLET::::- Another prequel novel set in 2009, \"Homeland: Saul's Game\" (2014), was released on October 7, 2014.\n","Section::::Reception.\n","Section::::Reception.:Critical response.\n","The first season received near universal acclaim. Metacritic gave it a rating of 92 out of 100 based on 29 critics. \"TV Guide\" named it the best TV show of 2011 and highly applauded the performances given by Damian Lewis and Claire Danes. Metacritic named \"Homeland\" the second-best TV show of 2011, based on aggregating the year-end top-ten lists of a number of major TV critics. The second season also received near universal acclaim, achieving a Metacritic rating of 96 out of 100 from 21 critics. The third season initially received generally favorable reviews, with a rating of 77 out of 100 based on 23 critics, but reviews became more negative as the season progressed.\n","Hank Stuever of \"The Washington Post\" gave the pilot episode an A\u2212, saying \"What makes \"Homeland\" rise above other post-9\/11 dramas is Danes's stellar performance as Carrie\u2014easily this season's strongest female character,\" and that \"The latter half of the first episode is exhilarating. I'm hooked.\" Matthew Gilbert of \"The Boston Globe\" gave it a solid A grade, and said it was his favorite drama pilot of the season. \"Entertainment Weekly\"s Ken Tucker gave it an A\u2212, stating \"It's the fall season's most intriguing, tense puzzler.\" IGN TV gave it a positive review, saying that it was an \"ace thriller\" that also managed to have something to say about the \"War on Terror\". The seventh episode, \"The Weekend\", received overwhelming critical acclaim and was described by both the creators of the show and Lewis as a \"watershed\" episode.\n","However, Greg Dixon of \"The New Zealand Herald\" criticized \"Homeland\"s thin plotting, Danes's \"insane levels of overacting\", and Lewis's \"passivity\". Robert Rorke of \"New York Post\" wrote about the third season \"Seldom in the history of cable TV has a series imploded as quickly as Showtime's \"Homeland\".\" and \"The show, in the middle of its third season, is now impossible to take seriously.\" In 2014, Laura Durkay of \"The Washington Post\" criticized \"Homeland\" for its portrayal of Islamophobic stereotypes and called it \"the most bigoted show on television.\n","Former U.S. President Barack Obama has praised \"Homeland\" and is known to be a fan of the show.\n","Section::::Reception.:Ratings.\n","The original broadcast of the pilot episode on October 2, 2011, received 1.08 million viewers, becoming Showtime's highest-rated drama premiere in eight years. The episode received a total of 2.78 million viewers with additional broadcasts and on demand views. The final episode of season one received 1.7 million viewers, making it the most-watched season finale of any first-year Showtime series. Ratings increased in Season 2, peaking with 2.36 million viewers for the December 9, 2012 first-run broadcast.\n","The series has also performed well in the UK, where it airs on Channel 4. The pilot episode drew 2.2 million viewers and the season one finale drew 2.8 million viewers. Season 2 saw a drop in viewership, with the season two premiere drawing in 2.3 million viewers, but the finale only 2.1 million.\n","Section::::Reception.:Awards and nominations.\n","In its debut season, the series received several industry awards and nominations. The series was recognized with a Peabody Award in April 2012 describing the series as \"a game of cat and mouse, a psychological thriller and a Rorschach test of post-9\/11 doubts, fears and suspicions rolled into one.\" At the 64th Primetime Emmy Awards, the series received nine nominations winning six awards, including Outstanding Drama Series, Claire Danes for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, Damian Lewis for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series, and Alex Gansa, Howard Gordon and Gideon Raff for Outstanding Writing for a Drama Series for the pilot episode. The series also won awards for Outstanding Casting for a Drama Series and Outstanding Single-Camera Picture Editing for a Drama Series.\n","At the 69th Golden Globe Awards, the series won the award for Best Television Series \u2013 Drama, and Claire Danes won for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama, with Damian Lewis receiving a nomination for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama. At the 70th Golden Globe Awards, the series won its second consecutive award for Best Television Series \u2013 Drama, Danes won again for Best Actress \u2013 Television Series Drama, and Lewis won for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Drama, after being nominated the previous year.\n","Section::::Reception.:Controversies.\n","In October 2012 the Lebanese government was reportedly planning to sue the show's producers, asserting misrepresentation of Hamra Street in Beirut, Lebanon. Specifically, in the second episode of the second season \"Beirut Is Back\", the street was shown as a narrow alleyway with militia roaming and associated with terrorist activity. In reality, the Lebanese government says, it is a bustling modern hub of cafes and bars. The Minister of Tourism Fadi Abboud said he would take legal action over the lies, saying \"Beirut is one of the most secure capitals in the world, more secure than London or New York.\" Coincidentally, on October 19, 2012, Wissam al-Hassan, a brigadier general of the Lebanese Internal Security Forces (ISF) and the head of its intelligence-oriented information branch, died along with several others killed by a car bomb in the Achrafieh district of Beirut. Although \"Homeland\"s co-creator, Gideon Raff, is Israeli and thus forbidden from entering Lebanon, Abboud also protested the filming of episodes in Israel rather than Lebanon.\n","Peter Beaumont of \"The Guardian\" wrote about the portrayal of Muslims in the series: \"High-profile Muslims living in the US share a secret: both willingly or otherwise they are covert helpers of Abu Nazir, the al-Qaida terrorist leader. In other words, it does not matter whether they are rich, smart, discreetly enjoying a western lifestyle or attractive: all are to be suspected.\"\n","Raff's works, \"Homeland\" included, have been criticized for their portrayal of Muslims. In an article for \"Salon\", Laila Al-Arian called the show the most Islamophobic show on television, accused it of portraying Muslims under the light of simplistic concepts and as a monolithic, single-minded group whose only purpose is to hurt Americans, and basing the Brody character to such an extent on \"pseudo-psychology that only an audience conditioned by the Islamophobic, anti-Arab tropes in our media could find him consistent.\" She further criticizes the show for fanning hysteria of Muslim \"infiltration\" of the United States; poor mastery of even basic Arabic; misrepresentation of Islamic and Arab culture; and simplifying the politics of militant Islamic organizations, for instance by conflating groups that in real life are rivals.\n","An article in \"The Atlantic\" by Yair Rosenberg challenged al-Arian's criticisms, arguing that they missed what made the show valuable, which was that it was no gung-ho salute to U.S. militarism and tactics on the war on terror nor a black-and-white portrayal of good Americans versus evil Muslims, but rather a show that challenges the prejudices of its viewers rather than affirming them. Similarly, Zach Novetsky asserted that al-Arian's criticisms was a function of the show's having enough \"depth and layers for someone to concoct a totally inaccurate interpretation of what the show really is about.\"\n","Middle East commentator Rachel Shabi opined that \"Homeland\"'s take on U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East does little more than defend the talking points of its advocates, presenting even U.S. violence against civilians as \"necessary acts in pursuit of far worse crimes\".\n","Middle East policy expert Fawaz Gerges told TheWrap, \"\"Homeland\" is poisonous to any attempt to bridge the divide between the two nations [United States and Iran]\".\n","The German news magazine \"Der Spiegel\" said that the show depicts \"hysterical CIA agents in a hysterical country,\" and demonstrates the \"paranoid tactics that delegitimize its democracy\" that the United States has applied and exceeded in real life, such as the tapping of German Chancellor Angela Merkel's phone.\n","In a 2014 report, the human rights group Amnesty International found relatively high levels of popular support for torture in the U.S. and Britain, in part due to the glorification of torture allegedly found in popular English language TV shows such as \"24\" and \"Homeland\".\n","In October 2015, three graffiti artists hired to add graffiti writings on the set of a season 5 episode (intended to portray a refugee camp on the Lebanon\u2013Syria border) to add \"authenticity\" to the scenes, wrote instead slogans accusing the show of racism.\n","Section::::Broadcast.\n","Internationally, the series premiered on November 1, 2011, on Super Channel in Canada, on January 13, 2012, on RT\u00c9 in Ireland, on January 22, 2012, on Network Ten in Australia, on February 19, 2012, on Channel 4 in the United Kingdom, and on September 30, 2013, on Star World in Bangladesh, India and Pakistan.\n","Section::::External links.\n","BULLET::::- \"Homeland\" at Emmys.com\n"]},"anchors":{"paragraph_id":[1,1,1,1,1,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,2,3,3,3,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,4,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,7,15,17,17,17,21,21,23,23,23,23,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,24,25,26,27,28,28,28,29,30,31,31,32,33,34,35,36,37,38,39,39,40,41,42,43,43,44,44,44,45,46,46,47,47,48,51,51,51,51,51,51,51,51,51,51,52,52,53,53,54,56,56,56,56,56,56,56,56,56,57,57,57,57,57,59,59,59,59,59,60,60,60,60,60,60,60,61,61,62,62,62,62,63,63,63,64,64,68,68,73,73,74,74,74,74,74,74,74,74,75,75,76,78,79,81,81,81,81,81,81,81,81,81,81,81,81,82,82,82,82,82,84,84,84,84,84,84,84,84,84,84,84,84,85,86,86,86,87,88,89,89,90,90,91,91,91,92,92,94,94,94,94,94,94,94,94,96],"start":[24,68,86,126,207,17,33,52,93,115,131,149,246,260,281,43,57,86,165,259,356,483,602,618,635,653,19,47,105,141,168,205,217,251,188,89,279,296,86,137,12,28,80,113,12,28,70,82,109,137,169,183,12,12,12,12,59,75,12,12,12,46,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,73,12,12,12,12,71,12,51,89,12,12,46,12,43,12,9,39,77,95,192,220,238,286,328,423,27,100,25,415,297,51,204,382,511,557,574,862,881,900,28,44,60,77,164,35,102,149,162,380,74,90,204,230,275,383,400,71,188,81,132,178,332,79,90,147,173,241,49,148,50,117,0,17,320,420,443,534,659,697,24,167,22,244,63,115,307,402,428,445,489,506,552,564,582,598,645,7,62,119,204,249,124,140,148,215,448,646,666,700,836,852,874,915,0,107,115,155,15,24,26,44,26,290,22,41,254,23,147,62,111,151,202,265,279,291,301,12],"end":[36,81,96,142,218,29,48,79,109,127,145,179,254,275,289,56,65,111,218,308,423,548,616,633,648,670,46,65,109,164,185,216,225,268,194,97,291,312,97,144,24,43,103,129,24,42,81,98,117,148,177,198,26,27,26,29,64,82,24,25,26,81,26,26,25,28,23,29,27,24,81,26,24,29,27,77,28,65,115,26,24,72,22,53,26,20,46,90,105,194,228,243,298,349,437,36,116,44,421,303,63,218,394,526,569,588,879,894,912,42,58,71,90,199,44,112,157,178,391,88,120,228,269,287,395,411,77,211,104,157,196,337,88,102,153,191,258,60,160,60,125,12,36,336,440,453,537,672,708,46,180,34,253,72,128,333,426,440,487,501,546,562,577,593,636,658,31,92,157,240,273,136,146,155,229,459,662,683,724,844,861,880,926,14,112,129,167,27,36,38,51,37,303,34,62,256,31,167,75,114,162,211,275,289,296,309,22],"text":["spy thriller","Howard Gordon","Alex Gansa","Prisoners of War","Gideon Raff","Claire Danes","Carrie Mathison","Central Intelligence Agency","bipolar disorder","Damian Lewis","Nicholas Brody","U.S. Marine Corps Scout Sniper","al-Qaeda","prisoner of war","\"turned\"","cable channel","Showtime","Fox 21 Television Studios","Golden Globe Award for Best Television Series \u2013 Drama","Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series","Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series","Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Drama Series","Mandy Patinkin","Morena Baccarin","Rupert Friend","F.

{"kilt_id":"31186339","wikipedia_id":"31186339","wikipedia_title":"The Hunger Games (film)","text":{"paragraph":["The Hunger Games (film)\n","The Hunger Games is a 2012 American dystopian science fiction-adventure film directed by Gary Ross and based on Suzanne Collins\u2019s 2008 novel of the same name. It is the first installment in \"The Hunger Games\" film series and was produced by Nina Jacobson and Jon Kilik, with a screenplay by Ross, Collins, and Billy Ray. The film stars Jennifer Lawrence, Josh Hutcherson, Liam Hemsworth, Woody Harrelson, Elizabeth Banks, Lenny Kravitz, Stanley Tucci, and Donald Sutherland. The story takes place in a dystopian post-apocalyptic future in the nation of Panem, where a boy and a girl from each of the nation's 12 Districts are chosen annually as \"tributes\" and forced to compete in The Hunger Games, an elaborate televised fight to the death. Katniss Everdeen (Jennifer Lawrence) volunteers to take her younger sister's place, and with her district's male tribute, Peeta Mellark (Josh Hutcherson), travels to the Capitol to train and compete in the games.\n","Development of \"The Hunger Games\" began in March 2009 when Lions Gate Entertainment entered into a co-production agreement with Color Force, which had acquired the rights a few weeks earlier. Collins collaborated with Ray and Ross to write the screenplay. The screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience and Ross added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow. The main characters were cast between March and May 2011. Principal photography began in May 2011 and ended in September 2011, with filming taking place in North Carolina.\n","The film was released on March 21, 2012, in some European countries and in the US and UK on March 23, 2012, in both conventional theaters and digital IMAX theaters. Japan received it last, on September 28. When the film released, it set records for opening day ($67.3 million) and opening weekend for a non-sequel. At the time of its release, the film's opening weekend gross ($152.5\u00a0million) was the third-largest of any movie in North America. It is the first film since \"Avatar\" to remain in first place at the North American box office for four consecutive weekends. The film was a massive box-office success by grossing over $694 million worldwide against its budget of $78 million, making it the third-highest-grossing film in the United States and ninth highest-grossing film of 2012. It was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on August 18, 2012. With 7,434,058 units sold, the DVD was the best-selling DVD of 2012. The second installment, \"\", was released on November 22, 2013, in the United States.\n","\"The Hunger Games\" received positive reviews from critics, with praise for its themes and messages, as well as Jennifer Lawrence's portrayal of Katniss, though there was some criticism of the film's use of shaky cam, especially in the action sequences. Like the novel, the film has been noted for its similarities to other works, including the Japanese novel \"Battle Royale\" and its film adaptation, Robert Sheckley's short story \"Seventh Victim\" and its Italian film adaptation \"The 10th Victim\", and the Shirley Jackson short story \"The Lottery\", with some criticizing \"The Hunger Games\" for being derivative of such works. Collins stated in an interview that her novel and screenplay drew on sources of inspiration such as the myth of Theseus, Roman gladiatorial games, reality television, and the desensitization of viewers to media coverage of real-life tragedy and war, not to think as just an audience member, \"Because those are real people on the screen, and they\u2019re not going away when the commercials start to roll.\" The song \"Safe & Sound\" sung by American singer Taylor Swift featuring The Civil Wars, won a Grammy Award and was nominated for a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song. For her performance, Lawrence won the Saturn Award for Best Actress, the Broadcast Film Critics Association Award for Best Actress in an Action Movie, the Empire Award for Best Actress and was also nominated for the New York Film Critics Circle Award for Best Actress.\n","Section::::Plot.\n","As punishment for a past rebellion, the 12 districts of the nation of Panem are forced by the Capitol to select two tributes, one boy and one girl between 12 and 18, to fight to the death in the annual Hunger Games until there is only one survivor. In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her place. She and fellow tribute Peeta Mellark are escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, the only victor for district 12 in the nation's history. Haymitch stresses the importance of gaining sponsors, as they can provide gifts during the Games. While training, Katniss observes the \"Careers\" (Marvel, Glimmer, Cato and Clove), volunteers from the wealthy Districts 1 and 2 who have trained for the Games from an early age. During a televised interview with Caesar Flickerman, Peeta expresses his love for Katniss, which she initially sees as an attempt to attract sponsors; she later learns his admission is genuine.\n","At the start of the Games, Katniss ignores Haymitch's advice and grabs some of the supplies placed around the Cornucopia, a structure at the starting point, and narrowly escapes death. Half of the 24 tributes die in the initial melee, and only eleven, including the Careers, survive the first day. Katniss tries to stay away from the others, but the Head Gamemaker, Seneca Crane, triggers a forest fire to drive her towards them. She runs into the Careers, with whom Peeta has seemingly allied, and flees up a tree. Peeta advises the Careers to wait her out. The next morning, Katniss notices Rue, District 11's young female tribute, hiding in an adjacent tree. Rue draws her attention to a nest of tracker jackers, genetically modified venomous wasps. Using a knife, Katniss saws the branch holding the nest off of the tree, causing it to fall on the Careers; Glimmer succumbs to the stings and dies, while the others escape to a nearby lake. Katniss is disoriented from being stung a few times; in a hallucination, Peeta returns and tells her to flee.\n","Rue helps Katniss recover, and the two become friends and allies. Katniss destroys the supplies the Careers have stockpiled by detonating mines guarding them, while Rue provides a distraction. Katniss later finds and frees Rue from a net trap, but Marvel impales Rue with a spear thrown at Katniss, who then fatally shoots him with an arrow in response. Katniss comforts Rue and, after she dies, adorns her body with flowers. Afterwards, she makes a three-finger salute to the cameras. This triggers a riot in District 11. President Coriolanus Snow warns Crane about the unrest that has been caused under his watch.\n","Haymitch persuades Crane to change the rules to allow two winners provided they are from the same district, suggesting that this will pacify the public. After the announcement, Katniss searches for and finds a gravely wounded Peeta. Another announcement promises that what each survivor needs the most will be provided at the Cornucopia the next morning. Despite Peeta's strong opposition, Katniss leaves to get medicine for him but is ambushed and overpowered by Clove. When Clove gloats about Rue's death, Thresh, District 11's male tribute, appears and brutally kills Clove by breaking her skull. He spares Katniss, for Rue's sake. Katniss takes the medicine, which heals Peeta.\n","While hunting for food, Katniss hears a cannon go off, signalling a death. She races to Peeta and finds he has unknowingly collected deadly 'nightlock' berries. They discover \"Foxface\", District 5's female tribute whose name they didn't know, dead from the berries she assumed were edible from watching Peeta.\n","Crane then unleashes genetically modified beasts. They kill Thresh and force Katniss, Peeta and Cato onto the Cornucopia's roof. There, the last survivors must fight to a stalemate. Cato gets Peeta in a headlock and uses him as a human shield against Katniss's bow. Peeta directs Katniss to shoot Cato's hand, enabling Peeta to throw him to the beasts below. As Cato is overrun by the beasts, Katniss kills him with an arrow to end his suffering.\n","However, the rule change about two victors is suddenly revoked the following morning. Peeta urges Katniss to shoot him, but she convinces him they should eat the 'nightlock' together. Just before they do, Crane hastily declares them co-victors. Afterwards, Haymitch warns Katniss that she has made enemies through these acts of defiance. Snow has Crane locked in a room with 'nightlock' berries, then watches the victors' homecoming before leaving the viewing room silently.\n","Section::::Cast.\n","BULLET::::- Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss Everdeen\n","BULLET::::- Josh Hutcherson as Peeta Mellark\n","BULLET::::- Liam Hemsworth as Gale Hawthorne\n","BULLET::::- Woody Harrelson as Haymitch Abernathy\n","BULLET::::- Elizabeth Banks as Effie Trinket\n","BULLET::::- Lenny Kravitz as Cinna\n","BULLET::::- Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman\n","BULLET::::- Donald Sutherland as President Coriolanus Snow\n","BULLET::::- Wes Bentley as Seneca Crane\n","BULLET::::- Toby Jones as Claudius Templesmith\n","BULLET::::- Alexander Ludwig as Cato\n","BULLET::::- Isabelle Fuhrman as Clove\n","BULLET::::- Amandla Stenberg as Rue\n","BULLET::::- Jacqueline Emerson as Foxface\n","BULLET::::- Jack Quaid as Marvel\n","BULLET::::- Leven Rambin as Glimmer\n","BULLET::::- Dayo Okeniyi as Thresh\n","BULLET::::- Willow Shields as Primrose Everdeen\n","BULLET::::- Paula Malcomson as Mrs Everdeen\n","Section::::Production.\n","In March 2009, Lions Gate Entertainment (known as Lionsgate) entered into a co-production agreement for \"The Hunger Games\" with Nina Jacobson's production company Color Force, which had acquired worldwide distribution rights to the novel a few weeks earlier, reportedly for $200,000. Alli Shearmur and Jim Miller, president and senior vice president of motion picture production at Lionsgate, took charge of overseeing the production of the film, which they described as \"an incredible property... a thrill to bring home to Lionsgate\". The studio, which had not made a profit for five years, raided the budgets of other productions and sold assets to secure a budget of $88,000,000\u2014one of its largest ever\u2014for the film. Collins' agent Jason Dravis remarked that \"they [Lionsgate] had everyone but the valet call us\" to help secure the franchise. Lionsgate subsequently acquired tax breaks of $8\u00a0million for shooting the film in North Carolina. The production was eventually brought in under-budget at $78\u00a0million.\n","Collins adapted the novel for film herself, in collaboration with screenwriter Billy Ray and director Gary Ross. The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, with Ross saying he \"felt the only way to make the film really successful was to be totally subjective\", echoing Collins' presentation of the novel in the first person present. Instead of Katniss' internal monologue about the Capitol's machinations, the screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience. Ross explained, \"In the book, Katniss speculates about the game-makers' manipulations... in the film, we can't get inside Katniss's head, but we do have the ability to cut away and actually show the machinations of the Capitol behind the scenes. I created the game centre and also expanded the role of Seneca Crane for those reasons. I thought it was totally important.\" Ross also added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow, the elderly President of Panem, noting that \"I thought that it was very interesting that there would be one generation [of Panem citizens] who knew that [the Games] were actually an instrument of political control, and there would be a successive generation who was so enamoured with the ratings and the showbiz and the sensations and the spectacle that was subsuming the actual political intention, and that's really where the tension is\".\n","The Gamemakers' control center, about which Katniss can only speculate in the novel, was also developed as a location, helping to remind the audience of the artificial nature of the arena. Ross commented, \"so much of the film happens in the woods that it's easy to forget this is a futuristic society, manipulating these events for the sake of an audience. The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room.\" Ross and visual effects supervisor Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal dei ex machina Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that \"we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [animals] that just appear at the end of the movie? We wanted to find a way to introduce them without having to explain specifically and exactly what they were and the game room was a really great opportunity for us to be able to do that.\"\n","Section::::Production.:Casting.\n","Lionsgate confirmed in March 2011 that about 30 actresses auditioned or read for the role of Katniss Everdeen, including Hailee Steinfeld, Abigail Breslin, Emma Roberts, Saoirse Ronan, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, Jodelle Ferland, Lyndsy Fonseca, Emily Browning, Shailene Woodley, and Kaya Scodelario. On March 16, 2011, it was announced that Jennifer Lawrence (who was at the time filming for \"\") had landed the coveted role. Ross described Lawrence as having \"an incredible amount of self-assuredness, you got the sense that this girl knew exactly who she was. And then she came in and read for me and just knocked me out; I'd never seen an audition like that before in my life. It was one of those things where you just glimpse your whole movie in front of you.\"\n","Though Lawrence was 20 when filming began, four years older than the character, Collins said that the role demanded \"a certain maturity and power\" and said she would rather the actress be older than younger. She added that Lawrence was the \"only one who truly captured the character I wrote in the book\" and that she had \"every essential quality necessary to play Katniss\". Lawrence, a fan of the books, took three days to accept the role, initially intimidated by the size of the production.\n","Contenders for the role of Peeta other than Hutcherson included Alexander Ludwig (who was later cast as Cato), Hunter Parrish, Lucas Till, and Evan Peters. Other actors considered for the role of Gale included David Henrie, Drew Roy, and Robbie Amell. In April 2011, John C. Reilly was in talks with Lionsgate to portray Haymitch Abernathy. The following month Lionsgate announced that the role had gone to Oscar nominee Woody Harrelson. The casting of Grammy winner Lenny Kravitz as Cinna, Oscar nominee Stanley Tucci as Caesar Flickerman, and Toby Jones as Claudius Templesmith, soon followed. Both got the role at the time they were promoting \"\". Multiple-Golden Globe Award winner Donald Sutherland was cast as President Coriolanus Snow in late May 2011.\n","Section::::Production.:Filming.\n","Gary Ross, Sam Mendes, David Slade, Andrew Adamson, Susanna White, Rupert Sanders, and Francis Lawrence were listed as possible directing candidates, but in the end Ross was announced as the film's director in November 2010. Fireman's Fund Insurance Company insured the production, but as part of the underwriting process insisted on a thorough risk analysis of hazards as diverse as wayward arrows, poison ivy, bears, bugs, and a chase across fast-running water.\n","Lawrence dyed her blond hair dark for the part of Katniss. She also underwent extensive training to get in shape for the role, including archery, rock and tree climbing, combat, running, parkour, and yoga, and had an accident on the last day of her six-week training phase, in which she hit a wall while running at full speed, but was not seriously injured. Other stars who dyed their hair for the movie include Josh Hutcherson as Peeta and Liam Hemsworth as Gale. Lionsgate hired Olympic bronze medal-winning archer Khatuna Lorig to teach Lawrence how to shoot.\n","With an initial budget of $75\u00a0million, principal photography began near Brevard in Transylvania County in Western North Carolina in May 2011 and concluded on September 15, 2011, with a final budget reported as between $90 and $100\u00a0million, reduced to $78\u00a0million after subsidies. Steven Soderbergh served as a second unit director, and filmed much of the District 11 riot scene. The movie was shot on film as opposed to digital due (in part) to the tightness of the schedule; as Ross said in an interview with \"The New York Times\", \"I didn't want to run the risk of the technical issues that often come with shooting digitally\u2014we simply couldn't afford any delays.\"\n","Virtually all production photography took place in North Carolina, with Lionsgate receiving tax credits of around $8\u00a0million from the state government to do so. Forbes magazine estimated that the state economy gained up to $60\u00a0million from the production, with over 5,000 people employed as extras, crew and support staff. Most outdoor scenes, both from the arena and from the outskirts of District 12, were filmed in DuPont State Forest; the Little River, with its multiple waterfalls, provided several locations for shooting the river running through the arena. To run across Triple Falls, Lawrence was attached to wires and ran on a board.\n","Many of the urban and interior locations, in the Capitol and elsewhere, were filmed in Shelby and Charlotte; other scenes also took place and was filmed in the Asheville area. Ross and production designer Phil Messina drew on the buildings of the 1939 New York World's Fair and symbols of political power including Tiananmen Square and Red Square, when designing the Capitol architecture, which they wanted \"to be set in the future but have a sense of its own past... it's festive and alluring and indulgent and decadent but it also has to have the kind of might and power behind it\". For Katniss' neighborhood in District 12, the production team found Henry River Mill Village, an abandoned mill town which Ross said \"just worked perfectly for the movie to evoke the scene\"; Messina explained that \"originally we talked about maybe building one house and the facade of the house next door and redressing it, and maybe doing some CG extensions... we ended up finding a whole abandoned mill town... it was absolutely perfect\".\n","For the costume design, Judianna Makovsky and her crew looked at a lot of photographs of coal mining districts from the 1950s in the search of a very American feel. The idea was to create clothing unique for every character and to differentiate strongly the people in Capitol and in districts Grey and blue prevailed in the color palette for the district, while the people in Capitol were chosen to look bright in theatrical hats, flowers, ruffles, with powdered and eyebrowless faces.\n","Section::::Production.:Music.\n","Section::::Production.:Music.:Soundtrack.\n","The soundtrack album for \"The Hunger Games\" contains songs inspired by the film; only three of them (\"Abraham's Daughter\", \"Safe & Sound\", and \"Kingdom Come\", respectively) appear in the film itself, during the closing credits. The first single from the film's companion album, \"Safe & Sound\" by Taylor Swift featuring The Civil Wars, was released on December 23, 2011. It reached number one on the iTunes overall charts in 12 hours. The music video for \"Safe & Sound\" was released on February 13, 2012. Along with separate songs from Swift and The Civil Wars, the soundtrack also features songs by The Decemberists, Arcade Fire, The Secret Sisters, Miranda Lambert featuring The Pistol Annies, Neko Case, Kid Cudi Academy Award winner Glen Hansard, The Low Anthem, Punch Brothers, Birdy, Maroon 5, Jayme Dee, and Carolina Chocolate Drops. The soundtrack was released on March 20, 2012. The soundtrack track list was revealed on iTunes on February 13, 2012, and on the 14th \"One Engine\" was released as the second single. Jennifer Lawrence singing \"Rue's Lullaby\" was not included on the soundtrack. The album debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Top 200 chart, having sold 175,000 copies in its first week. It is one of just 16 soundtracks to grace the top slot in the history of the Top 200 and the first since \"Michael Jackson's This Is It\" to debut at #1.\n","Section::::Production.:Music.:Score.\n","Lionsgate originally announced that Danny Elfman and T-Bone Burnett would score \"The Hunger Games\", with Burnett also acting as the film's executive music producer to produce songs for the soundtrack. Due to scheduling conflicts, Elfman was replaced by James Newton Howard. The score album was released on March 26, 2012.\n","Arcade Fire also contributed to the movie's original score. The group composed the fascistic-inspired Panem national anthem, entitled \"Horn of Plenty\", an important and signature leitmotif appearing throughout the film. \"We were interested in making music that would be more integral in the movie, just as a mental exercise,\" Butler, who co-wrote the song with Chassagne, explained. \"And there's an anthem that runs throughout the books, the national anthem of the fascist Capitol. So as a thought experiment, we tried to write what that might sound like. It's like the Capitol's idea of itself, basically.\" He further added that \"it's not a pop song or anything. More of an anthem that could be playing at a big sporting event like the [Hunger] Games. So we did a structure for that, and then James Newton Howard made a movie-score version of it that happens in several places in the film.\" Arcade Fire's Panem national anthem has received strong reviews. According to \"Spin\", \"'Horn of Plenty' pulls off the neat feat of sounding both exactly like Arcade Fire and exactly like a futuristic anthem. It still has one foot in the band's uncorrupted neighborhoods, but another is up on the podium at the end of \"Star Wars\" accepting an Olympic gold medal or something. Horns blare, a choir booms, strings swell, the martial percussion steals the show, and we just realized how much we love Big Brother.\"\n","The film also features a rather obscure analog track from the 1970s composed by Laurie Spiegel for its \"cornucopia scene\", as well as music by Steve Reich, \u00d3lafur Arnalds, and the Hypnotic Brass Ensemble. These do not appear on the soundtrack or score releases.\n","Section::::Reception.\n","Section::::Reception.:Critical reception.\n","\"The Hunger Games\" received mostly positive reviews from critics. Rotten Tomatoes gives the film an 84% approval rating, based on 298 reviews, and an average rating of 7.28\/10. The site's consensus states, \"Thrilling and superbly acted, \"The Hunger Games\" captures the dramatic violence, raw emotion, and ambitious scope of its source novel.\" On Metacritic, the film has a score of 68 out of 100 score, based on reviews from 49 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews\". Audiences polled by CinemaScore gave the film a grade A.\n","Many critics praised Jennifer Lawrence for her portrayal as Katniss Everdeen, as well as most of the main cast. According to \"The Hollywood Reporter\", Lawrence embodies Katniss, \"just as one might imagine her from the novel\". \"Empire\" magazine said \"Lawrence is perfect as Katniss, there's very little softness about her, more a melancholy determination that good must be done even if that requires bad things.\" Several critics have reviewed the film favorably and compared it with other young adult fiction adaptations such as \"Harry Potter\" and \"Twilight\". Justin Craig of Fox News rated the film as \"[e]xcellent\" and stated: \"Move over Harry Potter. A darker, more mature franchise has come to claim your throne.\" Rafer Guzman of \"Newsday\" referred to \"The Hunger Games\" as being \"darker than '\"Harry Potter\",' more sophisticated than '\"Twilight\"'.\" David Sexton of \"The Evening Standard\" stated that \"The Hunger Games\" \"is well cast and pretty well acted, certainly when compared with \"Harry Potter\" juvenile leads\".\n","Roger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" gave the film three stars out of four, praising the movie as \"effective entertainment\" and Lawrence's performance. Despite a largely positive review, he criticized the film for being too long and noted that the film misses opportunities for social criticism. Simon Reynolds of Digital Spy gave the film four stars out of five, calling it \"enthralling from beginning to end, science fiction that has depth and intelligence to match its pulse-racing entertainment value\". Reynolds also spoke highly of Lawrence's performance and director Gary Ross, whose \"rough and ready handheld camerawork\" meant that viewers were \"with Katniss for every blood-flecked moment of her ordeal in the combat arena\". However, film critic David Thomson of the magazine \"The New Republic\" called it a \"terrible movie\", criticizing it for a lack of character development and unclear presentation of the violence, describing the latter as \"un-American\".\n","Eric Goldman of IGN awarded the film four out of five stars, stating that director Gary Ross \"gets the tone of The Hunger Games right. This is a grounded, thoughtful and sometimes quite emotional film, with its dark scenario given due weight. Ross doesn't give the film a glossy, romanticized 'Hollywood' feel, but rather plays everything very realistically and stark, as Katniss must endure these outrageous and horrible scenarios.\" The film received some criticism for its shaky camera style, but it was said to \"add to the film in certain ways\". The violence drew commentary as well. \"Time\" critic Mary Pols considered that the film was too violent for young children, even though the violence had been toned down compared with the novel, while critic Th\u00e9oden Janes of the Charlotte Observer found that \"[...] the violence is so bland it dilutes the message\". Also writing in \"Time\", psychologist Christopher J. Ferguson argued that parents' fears of the effect of the film's violent content on their children were unnecessary, and that children are capable of viewing violent content without being psychologically harmed.\n","Section::::Reception.:Box office.\n","\"The Hunger Games\" earned $408 million in the US & Canada, and $286.4 million in other countries, for a worldwide total of $694.4 million. It made the largest worldwide opening weekend for a film not released during the summer or the holiday period, earning $211.8\u00a0million, which was just ahead of \"Alice in Wonderland\"'s previous record ($210.1\u00a0million).\n","In North America, \"The Hunger Games\" is the 22nd-highest-grossing film, the highest-grossing film released outside the summer or holiday period, and the highest-grossing film distributed by Lionsgate. Box Office Mojo estimates that the film sold more than 50 million tickets in the US. The film set a midnight-gross record for a non-sequel ($19.7\u00a0million), which is also the tenth-highest midnight gross overall. On its opening day, it topped the box office at $67.3\u00a0million (including midnight showings), setting opening-day and single-day records for a non-sequel. The film also achieved the sixteenth-highest opening-day and nineteenth-highest single-day grosses of all time. For its opening weekend, the movie retained the No. 1 spot and grossed $152.5\u00a0million, breaking \"Alice in Wonderland\"'s opening-weekend records for a film released in March, for any spring release, and for a non-sequel. Its opening weekend gross was also the largest for any film released outside the summer season and the eighth-largest overall. The film held the March and spring opening weekend records for four years until they were broken by \"\". It remained in first place at the North American box office for four consecutive weekends, becoming the first film since \"Avatar\" to achieve this. On June 10, 2012 (its 80th day in theaters), it became the 14th movie to pass the $400-million-mark. On April 20, 2012, Lionsgate and IMAX Corporation announced that due to \"overwhelming demand\", \"The Hunger Games\" would return to North American IMAX cinemas on April 27 for a further one-week engagement.\n","Outside North America, the film was released in most countries during March and April 2012, with the exception of China, where it was released in June 2012. On its first weekend ( March 23\u201325, 2012), the film topped the box office outside North America with $59.25\u00a0million from 67 markets, finishing at first place in most of them.

In his review for \"The Washington Times\", Peter Suderman expressed that \"[m]aybe it's a liberal story about inequality and the class divide. Maybe it's a libertarian epic about the evils of authoritarian government. Maybe it's a feminist revision on the sci-fi action blockbuster. Maybe it's a bloody satire of reality television\", but concludes the film only proposes these theories and brings none of them to a reasonable conclusion.\n","Reviewers and critics have differing views on whether the film represents feminist issues. Historically, among the \"top 200 worldwide box-office hits ever ($350\u00a0million and up), not one has been built around a female action star\". Manohla Dargis sees Katniss Everdeen as a female hero following in the lineage of \"archetypal figures in the literature of the American West\" such as Natty Bumppo, as well as characters portrayed by American actors such as John Wayne and Clint Eastwood. Katniss is also seen as defying normative gender roles: she exhibits both \"masculine\" and \"feminine\" traits equally. Dargis also notes that Katniss is a female character with significant agency: \"Katniss is a fantasy figure, but partly what makes her powerful\u2014and, I suspect, what makes her so important to a lot of girls and women\u2014is that she's one of the truest feeling, most complex female characters to hit American movies in a while. She isn't passive, she isn't weak, and she isn't some random girl. She's active, she's strong and she's the girl who motivates the story.\" Similarly, Shelley Bridgeman of \"The New Zealand Herald\" wrote that because the characteristics of \"athleticism, strength, courageousness and prowess at hunting\" are not given to a male protagonist, but to Katniss, her character is an abrupt departure from the stereotypical depiction of women as being innately passive or helpless. Mahvesh Murad of \"The Express Tribune\" said that the film's triumph is \"a young female protagonist with agency\", comparing her with Joss Whedon's Buffy Summers.\n","The film has drawn varying interpretations for its political overtones, including arguments in favor of left-wing, right-wing, and libertarian viewpoints. Bob Burnett of \"The Huffington Post\" observed the film displays a general distrust of government, regardless of the audience's political party affiliation. Steven Zeitchik and Emily Rome, in the \"Dallas Morning News\", also stated that some viewers formed an opinion about \"The Hunger Games\" as a parable of the Occupy Wall Street activity. \"The Huffington Post\" reported that Penn Badgley, a supporter of Occupy Wall Street, saw the film as a social commentary on the movement. Burnett also states that \"Collins doesn't use the terms 1\u00a0percent and 99\u00a0percent, but it's clear that those in the Capitol are members of the 1\u00a0percent and everyone in the Panem districts is part of the 99\u00a0percent\".\n","Steven Zeitchik and Emily Rome, in the \"Los Angeles Times\" and the \"Dallas Morning News\" reported that, among other disparate interpretations, some viewers saw \"The Hunger Games\" as a Christian allegory. Jeffrey Weiss of Real Clear Religion, published in the \"Star Tribune\" has remarked on what he saw as the intentional absence of religion in \"The Hunger Games\" universe, and has commented that while the stories contain no actual religion, people are \"find[ing] aspects that represent their own religious values\" within it.\n","Section::::Reception.:Precedents in film and literature.\n","Charles McGrath, writing for \"The New York Times\", said that the film will remind viewers of the television series \"Survivor\", a little of \"The Bachelorette\", and of the short story \"The Lottery\" by Shirley Jackson published in 1948 by \"The New Yorker\". David Sexton of \"The Evening Standard\" compared \"The Hunger Games\" unfavourably to Kinji Fukasaku's Japanese film \"Battle Royale\", as did several other critics; the novel had earlier faced criticism for its similarities to the novel \"Battle Royale\" by Koushun Takami. Jonathan Looms of \"The Oxford Student\" argues that it is \"unfair that the film is only drawing comparisons with \"Battle Royale\"\" but that it \"is a veritable pastiche of other movies\" as well, comparing it to \"The Truman Show\", \"Death Race\", the \"Bourne\" films, and \"Zoolander\", and that it is common for artists to borrow from and \"improve on many sources. Quentin Tarantino has built his career on this principle.\" It reminded an author at \"Salon\" of the 1932 film \"The Most Dangerous Game\". \"The Hunger Games\" has also been conceptually compared to Robert Sheckley's 1953 short story \"Seventh Victim\" and its 1965 Italian film adaptation by Elio Petri, \"The 10th Victim\", as the story and film feature a government-endorsed, televised (in the film's case) \"Big Hunt\", featuring contestants from around the world acting as \"hunters\" and \"victims\".\n","Wheeler Winston Dixon, a film professor at the University of Nebraska-Lincoln, listed several precedents: \"Battle Royale\", Jackson's \"The Lottery\", William Golding's \"Lord of the Flies\", \"Metropolis\", \"Blade Runner\", \"Death Race 2000\", and George Orwell's \"Nineteen Eighty-Four\". Manohla Dargis in \"The New York Times\" compares it to \"Battle Royale\", \"Ender's Game\", and \"Twilight\", but contrasts \"The Hunger Games\" in terms of how its \"exciting\" female protagonist Katniss \"rescues herself with resourcefulness, guts and true aim\". Steve Rose of \"The Guardian\" refers to the film as \"think \"Battle Royale\" meets \"The Running Man\" meets \"Survivor\". Writing in \"The Atlantic\", Govindini Murty made a list of touchstones the film alludes to, from the ancient Greek, Roman and Egyptian civilizations to modern references such as the Great Depression, the Vietnam and Iraq Wars, and reality television. For her part, author Collins cites the myth of Theseus, reality television and coverage of the Iraq War as her inspiration.\n","Section::::Reception.:Controversies.\n","During the film's opening weekend, controversial statements about various members of the cast arose, sparking open dialogue about issues of racism, sexism and unrealistic body image. Comparisons were also made between \"The Hunger Games\" premise of children killing each other, and the child soldiers of the Lord's Resistance Army led by Joseph Kony. In a Jezebel article published March 26, 2012, Dodai Stewart reported that several users on Twitter posted racist tweets, criticizing the portrayals of Rue, Thresh and Cinna by African American actors. In a 2011 interview with \"Entertainment Weekly\", Collins stated that while she did not have any ethnic background in mind for lead characters Katniss and Gale because the book is written in \"a time period where hundreds of years have passed\" and there would be \"a lot of ethnic mixing\", she explains \"there are some characters in the book who are more specifically described\", and states that both Rue and Thresh are African American. Lyneka Little of \"The Wall Street Journal\" states that although it is easy to find bigoted or offensive postings online, \"the racist 'Hunger Games' tweets, because they are so shockingly ignorant even by the standards of the fringes of the internet, have kicked up a storm\".\n","Fahima Haque of \"The Washington Post\", Bim Adewunmi of \"The Guardian\", and Christopher Rosen of \"The Huffington Post\" all reiterate the fact that Rue and Thresh are described in \"The Hunger Games\" as having dark brown skin, as well as Collins's assertion that they were intended to be depicted as African Americans. Adewunmi remarked that \"it comes to this: if the casting of Rue, Thresh and Cinna has left you bewildered and upset, consider two things. One: you may be a racist\u2014congrats! Two: you definitely lack basic reading comprehension. Mazel tov!\" Erik Kain of \"Forbes\" saw the controversy as a way to appreciate the value of free speech. He states that while society may never be free of racism, \"racist comments made on Facebook and Twitter quickly become public record. Aggregations of these comments, like the Jezebel piece, expose people for what they are. Sure, many hide under the cloak of anonymity, but many others cannot or choose not to. And as the internet becomes more civilized and its denizens more accountable, this sort of thing carries more and more weight.\" Amandla Stenberg responded to the controversy with the following statement: \"As a fan of the books, I feel fortunate to be part of The Hunger Games family... It was an amazing experience; I am proud of the film and my performance. I want to thank all of my fans and the entire Hunger Games community for their support and loyalty.\" Dayo Okeniyi was quoted saying \"I think this is a lesson for people to think before they tweet\" and \"It's sad... We could now see where society is today. But I try not to think about stuff like that.\"\n","A number of critics expressed disappointment in Lawrence's casting as Katniss because her weight was not representative of a character who has suffered a life of starvation. Manohla Dargis, in her review of the film for \"The New York Times\" stated \"[a] few years ago Ms. Lawrence might have looked hungry enough to play Katniss, but now, at 21, her seductive, womanly figure makes a bad fit for a dystopian fantasy about a people starved into submission\". Todd McCarthy of \"The Hollywood Reporter\" said that in certain scenes, Lawrence displays \"lingering baby fat\". These remarks have been rebuked by a number of journalists for pushing unrealistic body image expectations for women.\n","L.V. Anderson of \"Slate\" states that \"[j]ust as living in a world with abundant calories does not automatically make everyone fat, living in a dystopian world like Panem with sporadic food access would not automatically make everyone skinny. Some bodies, I daresay, would be even bigger than Lawrence's.\" Since none of Lawrence's male co-stars have come under the same scrutiny, Anderson concludes complaints about Lawrence's weight are inherently sexist. MTV asked for responses from audiences on the controversy and reported that most found criticism of Lawrence's weight \"misguided\". One response pointed to Collins's physical description of Katniss in \"The Hunger Games\" novel which reads: \"I stand straight, and while I'm thin, I'm strong. The meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me.\" \"Los Angeles Times\" writer Alexandra Le Tellier commented that \"[t]he sexist commentary along with the racist barbs made by so-called fans are as stomach-churning as the film's cultural commentary, which, in part, shines a light on the court of public opinion and its sometimes destructive power to determine someone else's fate\".\n","The film has been rated 12A by the British Board of Film Classification (BBFC) in the UK for \"intense threat, moderate violence and occasional gory moments\". To achieve that rating, Lionsgate had to cut or substitute seven seconds of film by \"digitally removing blood splashes and the sight of blood on wounds and weapons.\" The uncut version was ultimately released on Blu-ray in the UK with a 15 certificate. In the United States, the film was granted a PG-13 rating from the Motion Picture Association of America (MPAA) for \"intense violent thematic material and disturbing images\u2014all involving teens\"; as Collins had originally anticipated.\n","Screening of \"The Hunger Games\" was delayed indefinitely in Vietnam. The film was to be released on March 30, 2012, but, according to a member of the Vietnamese National Film Board, the Board considers the film to be too violent and unanimously voted for the indefinite delay. It was later banned.\n","Section::::Home media.\n","The film was released in North America and the Netherlands on DVD and Blu-ray Disc August 18, 2012, and in the rest of Europe on September 3, 2012. Extras include \"The World is Watching: Making The Hunger Games\", numerous featurettes, the propaganda video in its entire form, a talk with the director Gary Ross and also Elvis Mitchell and a marketing archive.\n","In its first weekend on sale, Lionsgate reported that 3.8 million DVD\/Blu-ray Disc copies of the movie were sold, with more than one-third in the Blu-ray Disc format. Three weeks after the release of the movie to home media formats in the US, over 5 million DVD units and 3.7 million Blu-ray Disc units have been sold. With 10,336,637 sold, it became the top-selling video of 2012. The entire Hunger Games series was released on 4K UHD Blu-Ray on November 8, 2016.\n","Section::::Sequels.\n","On August 8, 2011, while still shooting the film, Lionsgate announced that a film adaptation of the second novel in \"The Hunger Games\" trilogy, \"\", was scheduled to be released on November 22, 2013. In November 2011, Lionsgate entered negotiations with screenwriter Simon Beaufoy to adapt the novel for screen, since the post-production schedule for \"The Hunger Games\" was too crowded for Ross and Collins to adapt the next film as originally planned. \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" began production in the summer of 2012. Gary Ross did not return for \"Catching Fire\", and instead Francis Lawrence directed the film. On May 6, 2012, it was reported that Michael Arndt was in talks to re-write the script for \"Catching Fire\". Arndt officially signed on as the new script writer on May 24, 2012. \"The Hunger Games: Catching Fire\" began filming September 10, 2012, and concluded December 21, 2012; it premiered in London on November 11, 2013, before premiering on November 22, 2013 in the US as was originally scheduled.\n","In July 2012, release dates were confirmed for two films based on the last book \"Mockingjay\". \"\" was released November 21, 2014, and \"\" was released November 20, 2015. Lawrence, Hutcherson, Hemsworth, and Harrelson were all signed on to the whole franchise.\n","Section::::External links.\n","BULLET::::- \"The Hunger Games\" at The

{"kilt_id":"1591817","wikipedia_id":"1591817","wikipedia_title":"Adrienne Bailon","text":{"paragraph":["Adrienne Bailon\n","Adrienne Eliza Houghton (n\u00e9e Bailon; born October 24, 1983) is an American singer, actress and talk show host. She is a former member of girl groups such as 3LW and The Cheetah Girls. Since 2014, Houghton is one of the four co-hosts of the daytime talk show \"The Real\".\n","As an actress, Bailon appeared in \"The Cheetah Girls\" films, \"Coach Carter\" and \"All You've Got\". She has guest starred in numerous television series including \"That's So Raven\" and \"The Suite Life of Zack & Cody\". In 2014, Houghton became the first Latina host of a daytime talk show in the US.\n","Section::::Life and career.\n","Section::::Life and career.:1983\u20132002: Early life, career beginnings, and 3LW.\n","Bailon was born to a Puerto Rican mother, Nilda Alicea and an Ecuadorean father, Freddie Bailon, on October 24, 1983. She grew up in the Lower East Side of Manhattan. Bailon has an older sister, Claudette. Bailon's parents are divorced, and she was raised by her mother and stepfather, Joe Felix. She attended PS 110-The Monitor in Brooklyn and the High School for Health Professions and Human Services, but did not pursue a career in the medical field because of her musical endeavors. Bailon commented \"I really wanted to be an Obstetrician! I wanted to bring babies into the world...\" Bailon was discovered by Latin pop singer Ricky Martin in October 1999 while she was performing in a church choir at Madison Square Garden. Martin asked for the four best singers in the group, and Bailon was one of the four elected by Martin to perform as back-up singers as part of his Livin' la Vida Loca Tour concert show later that night.\n","Following the performance, Bailon became a member of the girl group 3LW. Bailon stated that she was spotted by a producer while on a field trip to Beth Israel, and was later offered a slot in the female trio. Bailon said \"... coming from very humble beginnings in the projects of the Lower East Side and not having any \"Hollywood\" connections... It did not seem realistic. I sang in church, acted in all the church and school plays... So when the opportunity came to join a girl group I was ready!\"\n","The group was signed to Epic Records. Kiely Williams and Naturi Naughton were the other two members of the group, and work on their debut album began in 1999. In 1999, the original line-up of 3LW formed. Their first single, \"No More (Baby I'ma Do Right)\", was released in the fall of 2000. \"No More\" was a chart success, and was followed by \"Playas Gon' Play\" in early 2001. The group's self-titled debut album, \"3LW\" was released on December 5, 2000. The album went on to be certified platinum by the RIAA, selling 1.3 million copies in the United States.\n","In the summer of 2001, the group embarked on the MTV \"Total Request Live\" tour along with Destiny's Child, Dream, Nelly, Eve, and Jessica Simpson. In 2001, 3LW recorded a song with various artists including Michael Jackson, Usher, Beyonc\u00e9, Luther Vandross, Celine Dion and Mariah Carey in response to the 9\/11 attacks called \"What More Can I Give\". In late 2001, they collaborated with Lil' Romeo and Nick Cannon for \"Parents Just Don't Understand\" on the \"\" soundtrack.\n","3LW spent the first half of 2002 in the studio, recording an album tentatively titled \"Same Game, Different Rules\". The album and its intended lead single \"Uh Oh\" were presented to the label, who felt it did not have enough urban radio appeal. The tracks from \"Same Game, Different Rules\" were leaked to the Internet in MP3 format, and Epic considered dropping the girls. A fan support campaign for 3LW, named \"Never Let Go of 3LW\" after their song \"Never Let Go\" spread to the radio, and the act was retained, despite the album loss. Recording a new set of tracks, the group returned in the summer of 2002 with the P. Diddy-produced single \"I Do (Wanna Get Close To You)\", featuring Loon. That same summer, the group performed a concert special on Nickelodeon titled \"Live on Sunset\". By August, the group was set to release its newest LP, \"A Girl Can Mack\", when member Naughton left the group for good after heated arguments. \"A Girl Can Mack\"'s release date was pushed back a month, but sales were still disappointing debuting at #15 on the \"Billboard\" 200 with a disappointing 53,000 copies sold in the first week. Approaching the time that the group was ready to deliver their second album, Naturi Naughton announced that she was no longer a member of the group. Naughton alleged she had had a number of conflicts and arguments with Bailon, Williams, and their management, which led to a heated argument in August 2002 involving an altercation. Not long after, Naughton claimed she had been forced out of the group.\n","Section::::Life and career.:2003\u20132008: The Cheetah Girls, 3LW disbandment, and acting career.\n","Williams and Bailon continued as a duo while using the \"3LW\" name, causing the press to jokingly refer to them as \"2LW\". According to a cover story for the October 2002 issue of \"Sister 2 Sister\" magazine, Kiely & Adrienne said they received death threats and that they had to beef up security. The departure of Naturi greatly affected the group's popularity and album sales. After the second single released from the album, \"Neva Get Enuf\", underperformed, auditions were held across the country for a new third member. Jessica Benson made the cut and joined 3LW in early 2003. Without Benson, the group might have had to split due to \"bankruptcy\". Jessica's first performance was on \"Live with Regis & Kelly\", followed by a performance on \"Soul Train\". In fall 2003, 3LW departed from Epic, signing with Jermaine Dupri's So So Def label. The group then began working on their fourth studio album.\n","While working on the album, both Bailon and Williams signed on to star in the Disney Channel film \"The Cheetah Girls\". They starred as two of four members of a female girl group named after the film, with Raven-Symon\u00e9 and Sabrina Bryan portraying the final two members. The movie was released in August 2003 and was a ratings success. \"The Cheetah Girls\" soundtrack debuted at #33 on the \"Billboard\" 200 and was later certified 2x Platinum by the RIAA. Bailon had a supporting role on Disney Channel's \"That's So Raven\" which she played Alana. In 2005, she starred in \"Coach Carter\" as Dominique, her first theatrically-released film. Walt Disney Records soon created a real-life girl group, composed of Adrienne, Kiely, and Sabrina. Raven was offered a spot in the group but declined, opting to focus on her solo career and her television series \"That's So Raven\". The trio began working on their first studio album, later revealed to be a Christmas album. The album, titled \"Cheetah-licious Christmas\", was released that year, and they soon left Walt Disney and signed to Hollywood Records in 2006. Bailon then starred in the MTV film \"All You've Got\", along with R&B singer Ciara. The movie was released to DVD in May 2006 and premiered on MTV.\n","The Cheetah Girls later returned to film the sequel \"The Cheetah Girls 2\". Though she was absent from the main group, Raven-Symon\u00e9 did return to film the sequel. The movie premiered on August 25, 2006, and brought a total of 8.1 million viewers, becoming the highest-rated Disney Channel original movie and beating the premiere of the first of the \"High School Musical\" films. The soundtrack to the movie was released on August 15, 2006, debuted at #5 on the charts and was certified platinum by the end of the year. The Cheetah Girls began work on their second studio album in January 2006. \"We'll be making a real album, not a soundtrack\", Bailon said. The Cheetah Girls' second single from \"The Cheetah Girls 2\" soundtrack, \"Strut\", considered their most successful single, was their highest peaking single to date, peaking at No. 53 on the Billboard charts. Bailon sung lead vocals and ad-libs. Their debut album \"TCG\" was released on September 25, 2007, and featured the single \"Fuego\", which charted on Hot Dance Club Play's chart and had its video played in heavy rotation on Disney Channel and MTV Tr3s.\n","Though they were heavily involved with The Cheetah Girls, Kiely and Adrienne were still members of 3LW, though progress on their fourth album had halted due to their work with The Cheetah Girls. The group's fourth studio album was originally called \"Phoenix Rising\", but was renamed \"Point of No Return\". The lead-off single, \"Feelin' You\", was added on radio stations July 12, 2006. The album was supposed to be released later that year but was pushed back to a 2007 release because of Adrienne and Kiely's involvement with Disney's Cheetah Girls franchise, and eventually fell off the release schedule. The album delays were caused by image conflicts between both groups. As a result, the album was never released. In early 2007, Bailon stated in \"Girls Life\" magazine that 3LW was on hold because of the Cheetah Girls project. However, rumors were finally put to rest by Bailon in an interview with Jonathon Jackson in 2008 when Bailon confirmed that 3LW officially disbanded after they were removed from the So So Def roster. Bailon and Williams decided to then pursue The Cheetah Girls franchise full-time.\n","In 2008, work on the third film in The Cheetah Girls franchise, titled \"\" was in works. According to Disney, the plot would involve the Cheetah Girls going to India to star in a Bollywood production. Like \"The Cheetah Girls 2\", it was filmed on location in a foreign country. In an interview, Bailon stated the movie would film for a three-month period, in India, and that she had been doing research for the film. She also stated that \"all of the original cast will be back\". However, Raven-Symon\u00e9 later confirmed that she would not return for this film, as she was busy with her fourth studio album and filming movies such as \"College Road Trip\". The movie premiered to over 6.2 million viewers, and reached 7 million viewers in its final half-hour. This still failed to meet the ratings of the first two and was the series' lowest-rated premiere. In the UK, its premiere night scored 412,000 on Disney Channel UK, making it No. 1 of the week, and received 182,000 on Disney Channel UK +1, also No. 1 on that channel for the week, totalling 594,000. Bailon recorded two solo songs for the film's , \"What If\" and \"Stand Up\".\n","In November 2008, Williams confirmed in an interview with \"In Touch Weekly\" that the group had officially disbanded to pursue solo careers in both acting and singing. Bailon and Bryan later confirmed the statement. As of 2012, the group is still disbanded, though all three members have stated they are \"open\" to working with one another again.\n","Section::::Life and career.:2009\u20132014: \"Empire Girls\", \"I'm in Love with a Church Girl\".\n","Following the breakup of The Cheetah Girls, Bailon was signed to Island Def Jam Records and began working on her debut studio album. First confirmed in a radio interview in New York, Bailon later confirmed the news on her official Twitter stating \"For everyone who wasn't in [New York] \u2013 I officially announced I have signed a solo deal with Island Def Jam! So, happy I'm finally able to tell you guys...\" Bailon began working on her debut album shortly after signing with the label. Her first official musical release were the songs \"Uncontrollable\" and \"Big Spender\", both of which were featured on the \"Confessions of a Shopaholic\" film soundtrack, released in 2009. The soundtrack featured songs from numerous artist, including Lady Gaga and The Pussycat Dolls. Later that year, she was featured in the Ghostface Killah song \"I'll Be That\", featured on his eighth studio album \"\".\n","Starting in 2007, Bailon began dating Rob Kardashian, the brother of Kim Kardashian. While dating Rob, Bailon appeared in a total of eight episodes of the reality series \"Keeping Up with the Kardashians\", appearing as Rob's girlfriend. The show saw Bailon and Kardashian get tattoos with one another, among other aspects of their relationship. The couple officially split in 2009. On the breakup, Bailon stated \"You know they say opposites attract. I\u2019m a real New Yorker [...] Sometimes I think the things that matter to us were different.\" Though the reasoning was not announced at the time of the breakup, it was later revealed that Rob had cheated on Bailon during their relationship, which was the ultimate reason they broke up. At the end of 2008, Bailon appeared on MTV New Year's show from Times Square, in advance promotion of her upcoming afternoon hosting on the channel. In 2009, Bailon hosted the programming block \"New Afternoons on MTV\", relocating to New York City for the job. That same year, she co-hosted \"MTV News Presents: Top 9 of '09\", the year-end MTV New Year's programming live from inside and outside MTV Studios in Times Square. In 2012, Bailon announced that she was taking part in the reality show \"\", which would revolve around Bailon and friend Julissa Bermudez. Bailon said of the show's premise, \"The show follows us wanting to take our careers to the next level, coming back to New York City, where we\u2019re originally from [...] to take our careers to that next level.\" The show premiered on June 3, 2012 and has been a ratings success for Style Network. Bailon later appeared in the music video for Pitbull's \"Give Me Everything\".\n","On November 1, 2012, Bailon appeared as the co-host of \"The Pepsi Pre-show Live\" alongside Jesse Giddings and Jim Cantiello, a podcast that was sponsored by Pepsi, and broadcast through \"The X Factor (U.S. TV series)\" website one hour before every episode in the live rounds of the show. Also in 2012, Bailon separated from Island Def Jam due to creative differences. Bailon played as Katalina Santiago in the film, \"The Coalition\", which was released on DVD and Blu-ray in February 2013. Bailon starred in the ABC Family movie, \"\", on April 21, 2013. The movie featured Bailon singing the Madonna classic,\"Like A Virgin\" with Sara Paxton and Chelsea Kane. Other songs Bailon sang in the film include a song entitled \"Everlasting Love\", alongside Paxton, Kane, and Drew Seeley. \n","She appeared in the film \"I'm in Love with a Church Girl\", which was released in October 2013. In 2014, Bailon became be the host of a competition show called \"Nail'd It!\" on Oxygen.The show was canceled after one season.\n","Section::::Life and career.:2014\u2013present: \"The Real\" and solo music.\n","Currently, Houghton is one of the hosts of the syndicated daytime talk show, \"The Real\", alongside Tamera Mowry-Housley, Loni Love, Jeannie Mai and Tamar Braxton (former co-host for seasons 1 & 2), which premiered on July 15, 2013.

{"kilt_id":"43376","wikipedia_id":"43376","wikipedia_title":"Boston Celtics","text":{"paragraph":["Boston Celtics\n","The Boston Celtics are an American professional basketball team based in Boston, Massachusetts. The Celtics compete in the National Basketball Association (NBA) as a member of the league's Eastern Conference Atlantic Division. Founded in 1946 as one of the league's original eight teams, the team play their home games at TD Garden, which they share with the National Hockey League (NHL)'s Boston Bruins. The Celtics are one of the most successful teams in NBA history; the franchise has won the most championships in the NBA with 17, accounting for 23.9 percent of all NBA championships since the league's founding.\n","The Celtics have a notable rivalry with the Los Angeles Lakers, who have won 16 NBA championships, second behind the Celtics. The rivalry was heavily highlighted throughout the 1960s and 1980s. The franchise has played the Lakers a record 12 times in the NBA Finals (including their most recent appearances in 2008 and 2010), of which the Celtics have won nine. Four Celtics players (Bob Cousy, Bill Russell, Dave Cowens and Larry Bird) have won the NBA Most Valuable Player Award for an NBA record total of 10 MVP awards. Both the nickname \"Celtics\" and their mascot \"Lucky the Leprechaun\" are a nod to Boston's historically large Irish population.\n","The Celtics' rise to dominance began in the late 1950s, after acquiring center Bill Russell in a draft day trade in 1956, who would become the cornerstone of the Celtics dynasty. Led by Russell and superstar point guard Bob Cousy, the Celtics won their first NBA championship in 1957. Russell, along with a talented supporting cast of future Hall of Famers including John Havlicek, Tom Heinsohn, K. C. Jones, Sam Jones, Satch Sanders, and Bill Sharman, would usher the Celtics into the greatest period in franchise history, winning eight consecutive NBA championships throughout the 1960s. After the retirement of Russell in 1969, the Celtics entered a period of rebuilding. Led by center Dave Cowens and point guard JoJo White, the Celtics returned to championship caliber, winning two NBA titles in 1974 and 1976. The Celtics again returned to dominance in the 1980s. Led by the \"Big Three\" that featured Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish, the Celtics won the 1981, 1984, and 1986 championships. After winning 16 championships throughout the 20th century, the Celtics, after struggling through the 1990s, rose again to win a championship in 2008 with the help of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen in what was known as the new \"Big Three\" era.\n","Following the win in 2008, general manager Danny Ainge commenced a rebuilding process with the help of head coach Brad Stevens, who led the Celtics to a return to the playoffs from 2015. During the following season, the Celtics clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference, but were eliminated in the Conference Finals. This prompted an aggressive rebuild in 2017, where the team acquired All-Stars Kyrie Irving and Gordon Hayward. However, the pair struggled with injuries throughout the 2017\u201318 season, and the team was again defeated in the Eastern Conference Finals.\n","Section::::Franchise history.\n","Section::::Franchise history.:1946\u20131950: Early years.\n","The Boston Celtics were formed on June 6, 1946, by Boston Garden-Arena Corporation president Walter A. Brown as a team in the Basketball Association of America, and became part of the National Basketball Association after the absorption of the National Basketball League by the BAA in the fall of 1949. In 1950, the Celtics signed Chuck Cooper, becoming the first NBA franchise to draft a black player.\n","Section::::Franchise history.:1950\u20131957: Arrival of Bob Cousy and Red Auerbach.\n","The Celtics struggled during their early years, until the hiring of coach Red Auerbach. In the franchise's early days, Auerbach had no assistants, ran all the practices, did all the scouting\u2014both of opposing teams and college draft prospects\u2014and scheduled all road trips. One of the first great players to join the Celtics was Bob Cousy, whom Auerbach initially refused to draft out of nearby Holy Cross because he was \"too flashy.\" Cousy's contract eventually became the property of the Chicago Stags, but when that franchise went bankrupt, Cousy went to the Celtics in a dispersal draft.\n","After the 1955\u201356 season, Auerbach made a stunning trade, sending perennial All-Star Ed Macauley to the St. Louis Hawks along with the draft rights to Cliff Hagan for the second overall pick in the draft. After negotiating with the Rochester Royals\u2014a negotiation that included a promise that the Celtics owner would send the highly sought-after Ice Capades to Rochester if the Royals would let Russell slide to #2\u2014Auerbach used the pick to select University of San Francisco center Bill Russell. Auerbach also acquired Holy Cross standout, and 1957 NBA Rookie of the Year, Tommy Heinsohn. Russell and Heinsohn worked extraordinarily well with Cousy, and they were the players around whom Auerbach would build the champion Celtics for more than a decade.\n","Section::::Franchise history.:1957\u20131969: The Bill Russell era.\n","With Bill Russell, the Celtics advanced to the 1957 NBA Finals and defeated the St. Louis Hawks in seven games, the first of a record 17 championships. Russell went on to win 11 championships, making him the most decorated player in NBA history. In 1958, the Celtics again advanced to the NBA Finals, this time losing to the Hawks in 6 games. However, with the acquisition of K.C. Jones that year, the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for more than a decade. In 1959, the Celtics won the NBA Championship after sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers, the first of their record eight consecutive championships. During that time, the Celtics met the Lakers in the Finals five times, starting an intense and often bitter rivalry that has spanned generations. In 1964, the Celtics became the first NBA team to have an all African-American starting lineup. On December 26, 1964, Willie Naulls replaced an injured Tommy Heinsohn, joining Tom 'Satch' Sanders, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, and Bill Russell in the starting lineup. The Celtics defeated St. Louis 97\u201384. Boston won its next 11 games with Naulls starting in place of Heinsohn. The Celtics of the late 1950s\u20131960s are widely considered as one of the most dominant teams of all time.\n","Auerbach retired as coach after the 1965\u201366 season and Russell took over as player-coach, which was Auerbach's ploy to keep Russell interested. With his appointment Russell became the first African-American coach in any U.S. pro sport. Auerbach would remain the general manager, a position he would hold well into the 1980s. However, the Celtics' string of NBA titles ended when they lost to the Philadelphia 76ers in the 1966 Eastern Conference Finals. The aging team managed two more championships in 1968 and 1969, defeating the Los Angeles Lakers each time. Russell retired after the 1969 season, effectively ending a Celtics dynasty that had garnered an unrivaled 11 NBA titles in 13 seasons. The team's run of 8 consecutive is the longest championship streak in U.S. professional sports history.\n","Section::::Franchise history.:1970\u20131978: Heinsohn and Cowens duo.\n","The 1970 season was a rebuilding year, as the Celtics had their first losing record since the 1949\u201350 season. However, with the acquisition of Dave Cowens, Paul Silas, and Jo Jo White, the Celtics soon became dominant again. After losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1972, the Celtics regrouped and came out determined in 1973 and posted an excellent 68\u201314 regular season record. But the season ended in disappointment, as they were upset in 7 games by the New York Knicks in the Conference Finals. John Havlicek injured his right shoulder in game six and was forced to play game 7 shooting left handed. The Celtics returned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA Finals in 1974 for their 12th NBA Championship. The teams split the first four games, and after the Celtics won Game 5 in Milwaukee they headed back to Boston leading three games to two, with a chance to claim the title on their home court. However, the Bucks won Game 6 when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar nestled in a hook shot with 3\u00a0seconds left in the game's second overtime, and the series returned to Milwaukee. But Cowens was the hero in Game 7, scoring 28 points, as the Celtics brought the title back to Boston for the first time in five years. In 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in six games. The Finals featured one of the greatest games in the NBA's history. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Suns trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force overtime. In double overtime, a Gar Heard turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at which point the Celtics prevailed. Tommy Heinsohn coached the team for those two championships. After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977, Boston went into another rebuilding phase. In the 1977 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted a young forward from UNC Charlotte named Cedric Maxwell. \"Cornbread\" Maxwell did not contribute much in his rookie season, but he showed promise. Auerbach's job became even tougher following the 1977\u201378 season in which they went 32\u201350 as John Havlicek, the Celtics' all-time leading scorer, retired after 16 seasons.\n","Section::::Franchise history.:1979\u20131992: The Larry Bird era.\n","The Celtics owned two of the top eight picks in the 1978 NBA draft. Auerbach took a risk and selected junior Larry Bird of Indiana State with the 6th pick, knowing he would elect to remain in college for his senior year but believing Bird's potential would make it worth the wait. The team would retain his rights for one year\u2014a rule that was later changed\u2014and Bird indeed signed soon after leading Indiana State to the NCAA Championship game. Freeman Williams was also taken, being traded before the 1978\u201379 season began.\n","In 1978, owner Irv Levin traded his stake in the Celtics to John Y. Brown, Jr. for control of the Buffalo Braves, which he moved to California as the San Diego Clippers. As part of the deal, trades were made between the two franchises which resulted in many former Braves joining the Celtics. A move that irked Auerbach was a trade Brown made with the Braves that saw Buffalo's franchise center Bob McAdoo join the Celtics in return for three first round draft picks Auerbach had planned on using for rebuilding the Celtics. The dispute nearly led to him resigning as general manager for a similar position with the New York Knicks. With public support strongly behind Auerbach, Brown sold the team to Harry Mangurian rather than run the risk of losing his famed general manager. The Celtics would struggle through the season, going 29\u201353 without Bird. Newcomers Chris Ford, Rick Robey, Cedric Maxwell and Nate Archibald failed to reverse the team's momentum.\n","Bird debuted for the Celtics during the 1979\u201380 season. With a new owner in place, Auerbach made a number of moves that would bring the team back to prominence. He almost immediately traded McAdoo, a former NBA scoring champion, to the Detroit Pistons for guard M. L. Carr, a defensive specialist, and two first-round picks in the 1980 NBA draft. He also picked up point guard Gerald Henderson from the CBA. Carr, Archibald, Henderson and Ford formed a highly competent backcourt, blending in well with the talented frontcourt of Cowens, Maxwell and Bird. With Bird winning NBA Rookie of the Year honors the team went 61\u201321, a 32-game improvement from the previous season. Playing strong in the playoffs, the Celtics fell to the Philadelphia 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals. Some thirty years later the Celtics broke their own single-season turnaround record.\n","After the season, Auerbach completed one of the most lopsided trades in NBA history, garnering a pair of future Hall of Famers for a pair of first round draft picks. He had always been a fan of stockpiling draft picks, so even after the success of the 1979\u201380 season the Celtics had both the 1st and 13th picks in the coming 1980 NBA draft. Seeking to improve the team immediately Auerbach sent them to the Golden State Warriors for both center Robert Parish and the Warriors' first round pick, the 3rd overall. He then used the pick to select University of Minnesota power forward Kevin McHale. With the addition of star prospect Larry Bird, the Celtics' new \"Big 3\" put the team back on the path to dominance.\n","Despite losing center Dave Cowens to retirement late in training camp, the Celtics went 62\u201320 under coach Bill Fitch in 1980\u201381. Once again the Celtics faced the 76ers in the Eastern Conference Finals, falling behind 3 games to 1 before coming back to win the 7th game 91\u201390. The Celtics went on to win the 1981 NBA Championship over the Houston Rockets, with Maxwell named NBA Finals MVP.\n","Following the 1981\u201382 NBA season, the Celtics once again met the Sixers, and fell behind 3\u20131 before losing Game 7 at Boston Garden. In 1983 the Celtics were swept in the playoffs for the first time by the Milwaukee Bucks; afterward, Fitch resigned and the team was sold to new owners led by Don Gaston.\n","In 1983\u201384, the Celtics, under new coach K. C. Jones, would go 62\u201320 and return to the NBA Finals after a three-year hiatus. Boston came back from a 2\u20131 deficit to defeat the Lakers for their 15th championship. Bird renewed his college rivalry with Lakers star Magic Johnson during this series. After the season Auerbach officially retired as general manager but maintained the position of team president. He was succeeded by Jan Volk, who had been with the Celtics since graduating from Columbia Law School in 1971, serving as the team's General Counsel since 1976 and assistant general manager since 1980. In his first major transaction Volk made an off-season deal with the Seattle SuperSonics to send Henderson in return for their first round pick in the 1986 NBA draft.\n","In 1985, the Lakers and Celtics met again in the championship round, with the Lakers winning. This was the first time the Lakers had defeated the Celtics in the finals, and the only time the team won a championship at Boston Garden. During the following off-season, the Celtics acquired Bill Walton from the Los Angeles Clippers in exchange for Cedric Maxwell. Walton had been an All-Star and league MVP while leading the Portland Trail Blazers to the 1977 NBA championship, but injuries had hobbled him since. Considering the talent Boston had in its frontcourt - \n","Robert Parish emerging as an All-Star center and one more future Hall of Famers - Walton was willing to come off the bench to help the team. Considered the best passing center in NBA history, he stayed healthy and was a big part of the Celtics' success in 1986.\n","The Celtics won the second pick in the 1986 NBA draft after a remarkably poor year by the Seattle Supersonics, whose draft pick rights had been included in the 1984 trade of Gerald Henderson. They drafted University of Maryland star Len Bias, one of the most heralded prospects of his era. Bias died 48\u00a0hours later of an accidental cocaine overdose. Despite the loss the Celtics remained competitive in 1986\u201387, going 59\u201323 and again winning the Eastern Conference Championship. Injuries to key players led to a Lakers series win in six games.\n","In 1988, the Celtics lost in six games to the eventual champion Detroit Pistons in the Eastern Conference Finals. Following the season, head coach K.C. Jones retired and was replaced by assistant Jimmy Rodgers. Boston's hopes for 1988\u201389 faded when only 6 games into the season Larry Bird underwent a procedure to remove bone spurs in his feet. Bird did not play until after the All-Star break, and the Celtics won just 42 games before a first round playoff defeat to the Detroit Pistons, who would go on to win the championship. Bird returned in 1989\u201390 and led the Celtics to a 52\u201330 record. In the playoffs the Celtics collapsed after winning the first two games in a best-of-five series against the New York Knicks, losing 3 straight, including the decisive fifth game at Boston Garden. Rodgers was consequently fired and replaced by assistant coach and former Celtics' player Chris Ford.\n","Under Ford's leadership, the Celtics improved to 56\u201326 in 1990\u201391, recapturing the Atlantic Division title even though Bird missed 22 games with several injuries. The Celtics again lost to the Detroit Pistons, this time in the Conference Semifinals. In 1992, a late season rally allowed a 51\u201331 Celtics team to catch the New York Knicks and repeat as Atlantic Division champions. After sweeping the Indiana Pacers in the first round, the Celtics lost a seven-game Eastern Conference Semifinals series to the Cleveland Cavaliers. Back injuries limited Bird to only 45 regular season games, and just four of ten in the playoffs. After thirteen NBA seasons and a gold medal at the Barcelona Olympics with the Dream Team, continued back trouble led Bird to retire in 1992.\n","The Celtics' struggle to maintain roster continuity with a salary cap led the NBA and NBPA to create the \"Bird exception,\" which allows teams to exceed the salary cap to re-sign players they've drafted, at an amount up to the maximum salary.\n","Section::::Franchise history.:1993\u20131998: Rebuilding.\n","The loss of Bird and aging of the team's other veteran stars forced coach Chris Ford into rebuilding mode. Hopes centered on 26-year-old Reggie Lewis, a small forward out of Boston's Northeastern University. In the first round of the 1993 playoffs Lewis fainted during Boston's four-game sweep by the Charlotte Hornets. An examination revealed heart problems, but Lewis was able to get doctors to clear him for a comeback. Before he could make it he died of a heart attack while shooting baskets at Brandeis University during the off-season. The Celtics honored his memory by retiring his number 35. With Kevin McHale having retired after the Celtics' playoff loss to the Hornets, Boston's original Big 3 era came to an end in 1994 upon Robert Parish's signing with Charlotte. The team collapsed, finishing out of the playoffs with a 32\u201350 mark.\n","In 1994, the Celtics hired former player and legendary towel-waving cheerleader M. L. Carr as the team's new vice president of basketball operations. Working alongside general manager Jan Volk, Carr selected University of North Carolina star Eric Montross with Boston's first round pick in the 1994 NBA draft. Montross became the new heir apparent in the paint, but failed to develop and was eventually traded. 1994\u201395 was the Celtics' final season in the Boston Garden. The Celtics signed aging Dominique Wilkins as a free agent, who led the team in scoring with 17.8 PPG. Second-year player Dino Ra\u0111a, a power forward from Croatia, added an interior presence the team had been lacking in 1993\u201394. The Celtics made the playoffs, losing to the heavily favored Orlando Magic in 4 games. In 1995, the Celtics moved from the Boston Garden to the Fleet Center (later TD BankNorth, then TD Garden). Carr fired Chris Ford and took the coaching reins himself. After drafting Providence College star Eric Williams, the Celtics struggled to a 33\u201349 record.\n","Things got worse in 1996\u201397 as the Celtics lost a franchise record 67 games, setting an unwanted NBA record winning only once against other Atlantic Division teams and just fifteen victories overall. In spite of the emergence of 1st-round draft pick Antoine Walker Carr's coaching stint was deemed a failure, and he took another job in the organization when owner Paul Gaston convinced star college coach Rick Pitino to join the franchise as the team's president, director of basketball operations, and head coach. Pitino's appointment as team president was controversial as Auerbach, the incumbent who had filled that role for more than 25 years, first heard about the change from local media. Unfortunately for the franchise, Pitino was not the savior everyone hoped he'd be. Auerbach bore the insult of being elbowed out with dignity, even as the team failed to improve.\n","The Celtics received the third and sixth draft picks in the 1997 NBA draft, and used the picks to select a brand new backcourt through Chauncey Billups and Ron Mercer. The young team that lost 67 games the year before was dismantled, with David Wesley, Dino Ra\u0111a and Rick Fox being let go, and Williams traded to the Denver Nuggets for a pair of second round draft picks (Williams would return to the Celtics in 1999 and played for four years). Walter McCarty was also acquired in a trade with the Knicks. With a promising start, upsetting the defending champions Chicago Bulls at home on opening night, and hard play from the youngsters that led to leaderships in turnovers and steals, the team improved its victories from 15 to 36 despite many losing streaks. Billups was subsequently traded to the Raptors during his rookie year, and Mercer was traded to the Nuggets during his third season.\n","Section::::Franchise history.:1998\u20132013: The Paul Pierce era.\n","The following year in the 1998 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted Paul Pierce, a college star who had been expected to be drafted much earlier than the Celtics' 10th overall pick. Pierce had an immediate impact during the lockout-shortened 1998\u201399 NBA season, averaging 19.5 points and being named Rookie of The Month in February as he led the league in steals. However, the Celtics continued to struggle as Pitino failed to achieve meaningful success. After Boston lost to the Toronto Raptors on March 1, 2000, on a buzzer-beater by Vince Carter, Pitino delivered the memorable \"Larry Bird is not walking through that door, fans\" speech. He resigned in January 2001.\n","Following the resignation of Rick Pitino, the Celtics saw modest improvement under coach Jim O'Brien. Paul Pierce matured into an NBA star and was ably complemented by Antoine Walker and the other players acquired over the years. While the team was 12\u201321 when Pitino left, O'Brien's record to finish the season was 24\u201324. Following the 2000\u201301 season O'Brien was given the job of head coach on a permanent basis. As a result of numerous trades, the Celtics had three picks in the 2001 NBA draft. They selected Joe Johnson, Joe Forte, and Kedrick Brown. Only Johnson managed to succeed in the NBA, becoming a perennial All-Star after leaving the Celtics.\n","The Celtics entered the 2001\u201302 season with low expectations. The team's success in the latter stages of 2000\u201301 was largely forgotten, and critics were surprised when the team, along with the New Jersey Nets, surged to the top of the Atlantic Division ahead of the Philadelphia 76ers, who were fresh off a trip to the NBA Finals. The Celtics won a hard-fought 5-game series with the 76ers in the first round, 3\u20132. Pierce scored 46 points in the series-clinching blowout at the Fleet Center. In the Conference Semifinals, the Celtics defeated the favored Detroit Pistons 4\u20131. In their first trip to the Eastern Conference Finals since 1988, the Celtics jumped out to a 2\u20131 series lead over the Nets, after rallying from 21 points down in the fourth quarter to win Game 3, but would lose the next three games to fall 4\u20132.\n","In 2003, the Celtics were sold by owner Paul Gaston to Boston Basketball Partners L.L.C., led by H. Irving Grousbeck, Wycliffe Grousbeck and Steve Pagliuca. The team made it back to the playoffs but were swept by the Nets in the second round, despite bringing Game 4 to double overtime. Before their elimination, the team hired former Celtics' guard Danny Ainge as general manager, moving Chris Wallace to another position in the organization. Ainge believed the team had reached its peak and promptly sent Antoine Walker to the Dallas Mavericks (along with Tony Delk). In return, the Celtics received the often-injured Raef LaFrentz, Chris Mills, Ji\u0159\u00ed Welsch, and a first-round pick in 2004. The Celtics made the playoffs, only to be swept in the first round by the Indiana Pacers, losing all 4 games by blowout margins.\n","Section::::Franchise history.:1998\u20132013: The Paul Pierce era.:2004\u20132007: The \"Doc\" is here.\n","The Celtics were a young team under new coach Doc Rivers during the 2004\u201305 season, having drafted youngsters Al Jefferson, Delonte West and Tony Allen in the 2004 Draft. Yet they seemed to have a core of good young players, led by Pierce and rookie Al Jefferson, to go along with a group of able veterans. The Celtics went 45\u201337 and won their first Atlantic Division title since 1991\u201392, receiving a boost from returning star Antoine Walker in mid-season. The Pacers defeated them in the first round yet again, with the series culminating in an embarrassing 27-point loss in Game 7 at the Fleet Center. After the season Walker was traded again, this time to the Miami Heat. Despite Pierce's career season, in which he averaged career-highs in points (26.8), the Celtics missed the playoffs with a 33\u201349 record, owing largely to a young roster and constant roster shuffling, which saw the likes of Marcus Banks, Ricky Davis and Mark Blount traded for underachieving former first-overall pick Michael Olowokandi and former all-star Wally Szczerbiak.\n","The Celtics continued to rebuild in the 2006 NBA draft. The Celtics selected Kentucky point guard Rajon Rondo, who was to become a key piece in the team's revival. In the second round the Celtics added Leon Powe. The 2006\u201307 season was a gloomy one for the franchise, starting with the death of Red Auerbach at 89. Auerbach was one of the few remaining people who had been a part of the NBA since its inception in 1946. The Celtics went 2\u201322 from late December 2006 through early February 2007 after losing Pierce to injury, the result of a stress reaction in his left foot. At first, the Celtics received a much needed boost from guard Tony Allen but he tore his ACL and MCL on a needless dunk attempt after the whistle. The Celtics compiled a record of 24\u201358, second-worst in the NBA, including a franchise record 18-game losing streak. At the end of the season, the Celtics, with the second worst record in the NBA, were at least hopeful that they could secure a high draft pick and select either Greg Oden or Kevin Durant to help rebuild the franchise, but the Celtics fell to fifth in the Draft Lottery.\n","Section::::Franchise history.:1998\u20132013: The Paul Pierce era.:2007\u20132012: The new \"Big Three\": Pierce, Allen, and Garnett.\n","In the summer of 2007, general manager Danny Ainge made a series of moves that returned the Celtics to prominence. On draft night, he traded the No.\u00a05 pick Jeff Green, Wally Szczerbiak and Delonte West to Seattle for perennial all-star Ray Allen and Seattle's second-round pick which the team used to select LSU's Glen \"Big Baby\" Davis. Then the Celtics traded Ryan Gomes, Gerald Green, Al Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Sebastian Telfair, and a first round draft pick to the Timberwolves, in exchange for Kevin Garnett. These moves created the \"Boston Three Party\" (the nickname given to describe the combining of Allen, Garnett, and Pierce by Scott Van Pelt in a \"This Is Sportscenter\" commercial), which promised to revitalize the team and lead them back to glory.\n","The Celtics completed the largest single-season turnaround in NBA history. The new \"Big Three\" of Pierce, Allen and Garnett went 66\u201316 in the regular season, a 42-game improvement. However, the team struggled initially in the playoffs. The Atlanta Hawks took them to seven games in the first round, as did the Cleveland Cavaliers in the conference semifinals. The Celtics defeated the Detroit Pistons in six games of the Eastern Conference Finals, winning two road games.\n","In the 2008 NBA Finals, the Celtics faced MVP Kobe Bryant and the Los Angeles Lakers for the 11th time, the first time since 1987. The Celtics won Game 1 at home 98\u201388, fueled by strong play by Garnett and Pierce's dramatic comeback from a second half knee injury. They also won Game 2 108\u2013102, despite nearly blowing a 24-point lead in the fourth quarter. As the series shifted to Los Angeles, the Lakers stifled Pierce and Garnett in Game 3 and won 87\u201381. However, the Celtics would overcome a 24-point deficit in Game 4 to win 97\u201391, the largest comeback in NBA Finals history. After again blowing a large lead, the Lakers hung on to win Game 5 103\u201398, sending the series back to Boston. In Game 6, the Celtics overpowered the Lakers, winning 131\u201392, clinching their 17th NBA title, and first since 1986. It remains the largest margin of victory in a championship-clinching game; Paul Pierce was named Finals MVP. The win in Game 6 was a sense of relief, as it was a difficult path to this championship; in that game, these Celtics set a record for most games a team had ever played in a postseason, with 26, surpassing the 1994 New York Knicks, whom Coach Doc Rivers played for, and the 2005 Detroit Pistons, each of whom played 25, but lost their respective finals in seven games (Knicks in , Pistons in ).\n","The 2008\u201309 Celtics started off the season at 27\u20132, the then-best starting record in NBA history. They also had a pair of 10+ game winning streaks including a franchise record 19-game streak. After the All-Star Break, Kevin Garnett was injured in a loss against the Utah Jazz, missing the last 25 games of the season. Garnett was eventually shelved for the playoffs. The 2009 Celtics still finished with 62 victories, but their playoff run would end against the Magic in the second round, losing in seven games after leading 3\u20132, the first such occurrence in team history. In the prior round they were pushed to a Game 7 against the Chicago Bulls, with four of those games went to overtime, yet the Celtics' experience was too much for the young Bulls.\n","The following year, with the return of Garnett from injury and the additions of Rasheed Wallace and Marquis Daniels, the Celtics started the season 23\u20135 and at one point had the best record in the NBA. However, Doc Rivers decided to lessen his aging stars' minutes to keep them fresh for the playoffs. As a result, the Celtics sputtered to an even 27\u201327 record the rest of the way and finished the 2009\u201310 regular season with a 50\u201332 record, with a better road (26\u201315) than home (24\u201317) record. Despite previous predictions the Celtics would never go deeper into the playoffs, the Celtics still managed to make the NBA Finals despite their lowly fourth seeding. They defeated the Miami Heat in five games, upset the top-seeded Cavaliers in six games and toppled the defending Eastern champion Magic, avenging their loss from the previous season. Rajon Rondo emerged as a bonafide superstar during post-season play, continuing his rise to fame beginning with his first All-Star appearance. For the 12th time, their opponent were the Lakers. After taking a 3\u20132 lead heading into Los Angeles for Game 6, the Celtics appeared poised to win their 18th title. But Kendrick Perkins, the team's starting center, suffered a severe knee injury early in Game 6, and the Celtics would lose Game 6, and go on to blow a 13-point lead in Game 7. After speculation coach Doc Rivers would resign to spend more time with his family, he affirmed on June 30, 2010, that he would return to the team for the 2010\u201311 season.\n","During the 2010 off season, with Perkins expected to be out until February 2011, the Celtics signed two former All-Star centers, Shaquille O'Neal and Jermaine O'Neal, along with Turkish center Semih Erden, their 2008 second round pick, and the return of Delonte West. Shaquille O'Neal's presence wound up leading to Perkins departure: the Celtics were 33\u201310 in games Perkins had missed during the year due to injury, with a 19\u20133 record with O'Neal played over 20\u00a0minutes. Consequently, Perkins was traded to the Oklahoma City Thunder in February, when the Celtics were 41\u201314 and held the Eastern Conference leaderboard despite another rash of injuries. Following the trade, however, they proceeded to win only 15 of their final 27 games to finish with a 56\u201326 record, sliding to the third seed, due to the injuries \u2013 O'Neal played only five minutes \u2013 and difficult adjustment of new Celtics such as Jeff Green, Nenad Krsti\u0107 and Carlos Arroyo. The 2010\u201311 season still provided three landmarks: the Celtics became the second team to reach 3,000 victories, Paul Pierce became the third Celtic to score 20,000 points after Larry Bird and John Havlicek, and Ray Allen broke the NBA record for most three-pointers made in a career. The 2011 NBA Playoffs started with the Celtics sweeping the New York Knicks 4\u20130 in the opening round, but in the second round they were ousted by eventual Eastern champions Miami Heat in five games. Shaquille O'Neal, limited to 12\u00a0minutes in two games of the second round, retired at the end of the season.\n","At the 2011 NBA draft, the Celtics acquired two Purdue teammates, JaJuan Johnson and E'Twaun Moore. During the short preseason following the 2011 NBA lockout, the Celtics signed free agents Marquis Daniels, Chris Wilcox, Keyon Dooling and Greg Stiemsma, while acquiring Brandon Bass from the Magic for Glen Davis and Von Wafer. They also re-signed Jeff Green, only to have it voided after a physical revealed that Green was diagnosed with an aortic aneurysm, forcing him to miss the season. The Celtics started the season 0\u20133 with Paul Pierce out with a heel injury and his replacement Micka\u00ebl Pi\u00e9trus taking long to debut. The struggles led to the longest losing streak in the \"Big Three\" era with five games, and by the All-Star break, the Celtics were below .500 with a 15\u201317 record. However, they were one of the hottest teams after the break, going 24\u201310 the rest of the year and winning their 5th division title in a row. The Celtics would end up making the playoffs as the fourth seed in the Eastern Conference in the 2012 NBA Playoffs.\n","In the playoffs, the Celtics faced the Atlanta Hawks in the first round, beating them in six games led by strong play from Pierce and Garnett. In the Conference Semifinals the Celtics faced the Philadelphia 76ers led by Doug Collins and a young group of promising players that would push the Celtics into a seven-game series. Following a Game 7 85\u201375 win the Celtics faced the Miami Heat in the Eastern Conference Finals, who had defeated them in the playoffs the previous year. After losing the first two games in Miami, Boston fought back and won the next three games. With the possibility of closing the series at home, the Celtics suffered a blowout loss at the TD Garden of 98\u201379, taking the series back to Miami for Game 7, where the Celtics built an early lead but eventually lost 101\u201388; Miami would go on to defeat the Oklahoma City Thunder in the Finals.\n","The 2012 off-season started with the Celtics having only six players under contract. While Kevin Garnett renewed, Ray Allen chose to sign with the Miami Heat for less money, bringing the five-year \"Big Three\" era to a somewhat acrimonious end. The Celtics also signed free agents Jason Terry, Jason Collins, Darko Mili\u010di\u0107 and Leandro Barbosa; acquired Courtney Lee in a three-team sign and trade \u2013 where Johnson, Moore, Sean Williams and a future second round pick were sent to the Houston Rockets and the Portland Trail Blazers got Sasha Pavlovic; drafted three players, Jared Sullinger, Fab Melo and Kris Joseph; and renewed with Brandon Bass along with Chris Wilcox and Jeff Green, who both were returning to play after sustaining season-ending heart ailments.\n","Despite losing Rondo and Sullinger to injury, the Celtics compiled a seven-game winning streak, including victories over the Heat in double overtime and the Nuggets in triple overtime. The winning streak was snapped on February 12 when Leandro Barbosa suffered a season-ending torn ACL. To compensate, the Celtics signed swingman Terrence Williams, forwards D. J. White and Shavlik Randolph, and traded Barbosa and Collins to the Washington Wizards in exchange for guard Jordan Crawford. The Celtics finished the season with 41 wins, but played only 81 games after a home game against the Indiana Pacers on April 16 was cancelled following the Boston Marathon bombings; the game was not made up with both teams already assured of their playoff positions. The 41 wins were the lowest totals the Celtics achieved as a playoff-bound team since 2004. The Celtics trailed 3\u20130 to the New York Knicks in the first round of the 2013 NBA Playoffs, before losing the series in six games. In Game 6, the Celtics nearly completed a comeback when they went on a 20\u20130 run to cut the lead to 4, but that was the closest they got as the New York Knicks would take over to win.\n","During the off-season, head coach Doc Rivers was allowed out of his contract and left to coach the Los Angeles Clippers, giving the Celtics a 2015 unprotected first round pick as compensation. A few days later, Paul Pierce and Kevin Garnett (after waiving his no-trade clause), along with Jason Terry and D. J. White, were traded to the Brooklyn Nets for Keith Bogans, MarShon Brooks, Kris Humphries, Kris Joseph, Gerald Wallace, and three future first-round draft picks (2014, 2016, 2018), with the right to swap 2017 first-round picks with Brooklyn. The deal was later approved by the league on July 12, 2013, effectively ending the 'Big 3' era and marking the start of a youth movement for the team.\n","Section::::Franchise history.:2013\u2013present: Brad Stevens era.\n","On July 3, 2013, the Celtics announced that Brad Stevens, the head coach of Butler University, would replace Doc Rivers as head coach. Halfway through the season, in January, Rajon Rondo made his return and was named the 15th Team Captain in team history, and the team furthered the youth movement by acquiring two draft picks in a three team trade that sent Jordan Crawford and MarShon Brooks to the Golden State Warriors while the Celtics received the Heat center Joel Anthony. The 2013\u201314 season marked the Celtics' first missed playoffs since the \"Big Three\".\n","The next off-season, the Celtics drafted Marcus Smart with the 6th overall pick and James Young with the 17th overall pick in the 2014 NBA draft, and signed Evan Turner. The 2014\u201315 season had several roster moves, the most prominent being Rondo and rookie Dwight Powell traded to the Dallas Mavericks for center Brandan Wright, forward Jae Crowder, veteran point guard Jameer Nelson, and future picks. A total of 22 players spent time with the Celtics, leading scorer and rebounder Sullinger suffered a season-ending left metatarsal stress fracture, and the team was only tenth in the East with 28 games remaining. However, midseason acquisition Isaiah Thomas helped the team win 22 of their last 34 games, finishing the season with a 40\u201342 record, enough for the seventh seed in the Eastern Conference Playoffs. The Celtics were swept by the second seeded Cleveland Cavaliers in the first round.\n","In the 2015 NBA draft Boston selected Terry Rozier, R.J. Hunter, Jordan Mickey, and Marcus Thornton with the 16th, 28th, 33rd, and 45th selections respectively. During the off-season, the Celtics signed forward Amir Johnson and traded Gerald Wallace and Chris Babb in exchange for Warriors forward David Lee. The Celtics finished the 2015\u201316 NBA season with a 48\u201334 record, earning the fifth seed in the Eastern Conference. They played the fourth seed Atlanta Hawks in the first round of the playoffs. After leading by 3 points in the fourth quarter of Game 1, guard Avery Bradley went down with a hamstring injury, making him sit out for the rest of the series. The Celtics lost the series 4\u20132 to the Hawks, ending their season.\n","On July 8, 2016, the Celtics signed 4-time All-Star Al Horford. The Celtics finished the 2016\u201317 season with a 53\u201329 record and clinched the top seed in the Eastern Conference. After a hip injury ended Thomas' impressive playoff run in game 2 of the Eastern Conference Finals, the Celtics eventually lost to the Cavaliers in five games.\n","For the 2017 NBA draft, the Celtics won the draft lottery, earning them the first pick. They were projected to select freshman guard Markelle Fultz, but the pick was subsequently traded to the Philadelphia 76ers in exchange for the third pick in the 2017 draft and future picks. The 76ers would go on to draft Fultz, while the Celtics used the third pick to select freshman forward Jayson Tatum. Semi Ojeleye, Kadeem Allen, and Jabari Bird were selected with the 37th, 53rd, and 56th selections, respectively, in the second round. At the start of the off-season, the team signed Tatum and Ante \u017di\u017ei\u0107, among others, with the biggest acquisition being the signing of Gordon Hayward. On August 22, 2017, the Celtics agreed to a deal that sent Isaiah Thomas, Jae Crowder, \u017di\u017ei\u0107, and the Brooklyn Nets' 2018 first round draft pick to the Cleveland Cavaliers in exchange for Kyrie Irving. An additional draft pick (Celtics' 2020 second round) was later added to the package from the Celtics to the Cavaliers after doctors revealed that Thomas's injury was more significant than initially anticipated.\n","By the end of the off-season, only 4 Celtics' players remained from the 2016\u201317 team, with Marcus Smart being the longest tenured Celtic from the 2014 NBA draft. On the team's opening night game in the first quarter against the Cavaliers, Hayward suffered a fractured tibia and dislocated ankle in his left leg, causing him to be ruled out for the rest of the regular season. Despite the loss, the Celtics went on a 16-game winning streak, which also went down as the fourth-longest winning streak in the teams' history. The streak started with a 102\u201392 victory over the Philadelphia 76ers on October 20 and ended on November 22 to the hands of the Miami Heat with a 98\u2013104 loss. The Celtics finished the year with a 55\u201327 record, good enough for second place in the Eastern Conference. In the playoffs, they defeated the Milwaukee Bucks in the First Round in seven games, and continued the feat in the Conference Semifinals by defeating the Philadelphia 76ers in five games before losing to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games in the Conference Finals.\n","The Celtics finished the 2018\u201319 with a 49\u201333 record. Analysts started questioning team's performance and chances for the championship when the Celtics had a 10\u201310 record after the first 20 games on November 24, 2018. The Celtics then won the next eight games improving their record to 18\u201310. During the eight-game win streak, the Celtics defeated the Cleveland Cavaliers 128\u201395, the New York Knicks 128\u2013100, and also defeated the Chicago Bulls by 56 points (133\u201377), setting a record for the largest margin in a victory in franchise history, while also tying the record for largest victory margin by an away team. On February 9, 2019, the Celtics lost 129\u2013128 to the Los Angeles Lakers after former Celtic Rajon Rondo hit the first game-winning shot in his NBA career. The Celtics finished the regular season place fourth in the Eastern Conference. During an April 7 game Marcus Smart injured his hip and was ruled out for the rest of the regular season and the first round of the playoffs. In the 2019 playoffs, the Celtics swept the Indiana Pacers in the first round, and then lost to the Milwaukee Bucks in five games.\n","In the 2019 NBA draft, the Celtics held the 14th, 20th, 22nd, and 51st picks. The Celtics selected Romeo Langford with the 14th pick. The Celtics selected Matisse Thybulle with the 20th pick, then traded his draft rights to the Philadelphia 76ers for the 24th pick and 33rd pick. The Celtics used their 22nd pick on Grant Williams, then selected Ty Jerome with the 24th pick. The Celtics then traded the rights to Jerome, along with Aron Baynes, for a future first round pick. The Celtics then selected Carsen Edwards with the 33rd pick, and Tremont Waters with the 51st pick. During the 2019 offseason, the Celtics made free agency moves after losing Kyrie Irving and Al Horford in free agency. On June 30, 2019, the Celtics and guard Kemba Walker agreed to a four year maximum contract worth $141 million. On July 6, 2019, the Celtics officially acquired Walker in a sign and trade with the Charlotte Hornets. The Celtics sent guard Terry Rozier and a protected 2020 second round draft pick to Charlotte in exchange for Walker and a 2020 second round draft pick. On July 1, 2019, the Celtics agreed to a two year\/$10 million contract with center Enes Kanter.\n","Section::::Rivalries.\n","Section::::Rivalries.:Atlanta Hawks.\n","The Celtics\u2013Hawks rivalry is a rivalry in the Eastern Conference of the National Basketball Association that has lasted for over five decades, although the two teams have played each other since the 1949\u201350 season, when the then-Tri-Cities Blackhawks joined the NBA as part of the National Basketball League and the Basketball Association of America merger. However, the Blackhawks could not field a truly competitive team until they moved to St. Louis as the St. Louis Hawks after a four-year stopover at Milwaukee. The two teams have faced each other eleven times in the NBA Playoffs, four times in the NBA Finals, with the Celtics winning ten of twelve series against the Hawks, including three out of four NBA Finals. While the Hawks have only defeated the Celtics twice out of eleven series in the NBA Playoffs, they still often managed to make their series with the Celtics memorable. The rivalry intensified in 2016 with Hawks All-Star Center Al Horford spurning the team and joining the Celtics.\n","Section::::Rivalries.:Brooklyn Nets.\n","The Boston Celtics were once rivals of the New Jersey Nets during the early 2000s due to their respective locations and their burgeoning stars. The Nets were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, while the Celtics were experiencing newfound success behind Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker. The rivalry began to heat up in the 2002 Eastern Conference Finals, which was preceded by trash talking from the Celtics who claimed Martin was a \"fake\" tough guy. Things progressed as the series started, and on-court tensions seemed to spill into the stands. Celtics' fans berated Kidd and his family with chants of \"Wife Beater!\" in response to Kidd's 2001 domestic abuse charge. When asked about the fan barbs being traded, Kenyon Martin stated, \"Our fans hate them, their fans hate us.\" Bill Walton said at the time that Nets-Celtics was the \"beginning of the next great NBA rivalry\" during the Eastern Conference Finals in 2002 with the Nets advancing to the NBA Finals, though New Jersey would go on to sweep Boston in the 2003 playoffs. In 2012, the year the Nets returned to New York in the borough of Brooklyn, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court on November 28, resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo, Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined. The story was revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett's shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike. However, the rivalry between the Nets and the Celtics appeared significantly cooled off by the June 2013 blockbuster trade that dealt Celtics stars Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Nets in exchange for Wallace, Humphries, and others. This move was billed as a merger of the two Atlantic Division teams. Celtics announcer Sean Grande said \"It's almost as if you found a great home for these guys. You couldn't have found a better place. These guys will be in the New York market, they'll be on a competitive team, they'll stay on national TV. It's funny, because the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So with Celtics fans feeling the way they do about the Heat, feeling the way they do about the Knicks, the Nets are going to become almost the second [Boston] team now.\" The trade would end up crippling the Nets who posted a record of 151\u2013259 following the trade including three consecutive seasons with fewer than 30 wins from 2016 to 2018. Brooklyn would win just one playoff series with Garnett and Pierce, neither of whom were with the team by the close of the 2014\u20132015 season. The Celtics would use Brooklyn's draft picks to acquire Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum through the draft in 2016 and 2017 respectively and Kyrie Irving via trade, en route to consecutive appearances in the Eastern Conference Finals in 2017 and 2018.\n","Section::::Rivalries.:Detroit Pistons.\n","The rivalry between the Celtics and the Detroit Pistons peaked in the 1980s, featuring players such as Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, Robert Parish, Isiah Thomas, Bill Laimbeer, Dennis Rodman, and Joe Dumars. These teams met in the NBA Playoffs five times in 7 seasons from 1985 to 1991, with the Celtics winning in 1985 and 1987, and the Pistons coming out on top en route to back-to-back Finals appearances in and their championship seasons of and . Led by Paul Pierce, Kevin Garnett and Ray Allen in the 2008 Eastern Conference Finals the Celtics defeated the Pistons in 6 games to advance to the NBA Finals where they went on to beat the Lakers also in 6 games.\n","Section::::Rivalries.:Los Angeles Lakers.\n","The rivalry between the Boston Celtics and Los Angeles Lakers involves the two most storied franchises in NBA history. It has been called the NBA's best rivalry. The two teams have met a record twelve times in the NBA Finals, starting with their first Finals meeting in . They would go on to dominate the league in the 1960s and the 1980s, facing each other six times in the 1960s, three times in the 1980s, in 2008, and in 2010.\n","The rivalry had been less intense since the retirements of Magic Johnson and Larry Bird in the early 1990s, but in 2008 it was renewed as the Celtics and Lakers met in the Finals for the first time since 1987, with the Celtics winning the series in six games. They faced off once again in the 2010 NBA Finals which the Lakers won in seven games. The two teams have won the two highest numbers of championships, the Celtics 17, the Lakers 16; together, the 33 championships account for almost half of the 73 championships in NBA history.\n","Section::::Rivalries.:New York Knicks.\n","The rivalry between the Celtics and the New York Knicks stems from the location of the teams, both of which are in the NBA's Atlantic division. It is one of many rivalries between Boston and New York teams. Boston and New York are also the only two original NBA franchises that have remained in the same city for the duration of their existence. The teams have played 512 games against each other during the regular season, with the Celtics winning 276 times. The two teams have also faced each other 61 times during the playoffs, with the Celtics winning 34 times.\n","Section::::Rivalries.:Philadelphia 76ers.\n","The Celtics and the Philadelphia 76ers are the two teams who have the most meetings in the NBA Playoffs, playing each other in 19 series, of which the Celtics have won 12. The 76ers are considered as the Celtics' biggest rival in the Eastern Conference. The rivalry reached its peak when players Bill Russell and Wilt Chamberlain of the 76ers played each other from 1965 to 1968. Their play would result in the Celtics not winning every NBA Finals series in the 1960s when the Sixers won in 1967.\n","Section::::Rivalries.:Washington Wizards.\n","The most recent and unexpected rivalry that has been created between the Celtics is with the Washington Wizards. Although both teams had engaged in a fight in 1984, the rivalry intensified during the 2015\u201316 season in a January regular season game after Jae Crowder was given a technical foul. Crowder then began to exchange words with then Wizards coach Randy Wittman. It began to escalate that off-season when the Celtics were trying to sign Al Horford. It was publicly reported that Jae Crowder emphasized that the Celtics beat the Wizards in all of their meetings that season and should sign with them rather than Washington. In their first meeting of the 2016\u201317 season, Wall hit Marcus Smart in the back-court when they were up by 20 late in the 4th quarter. Wall was hit with a Flagrant 2 foul and was promptly ejected. Smart immediately got back up and began to scuffle with Wall. Their words continued even after being separated with Wall telling Smart to meet him out back after the game. No incident was reported between the two following the game. In their next meeting, the Celtics won 117\u2013108. However, after the game Wall and Crowder exchanged words in front of the Wizards bench. Crowder ended up trying to jab his finger at Wall's nose and Wall tried to fight back with a slap. Teammates and coaches from both sides had to step in and separate the two teams but the players continued to yell while entering their respective locker rooms. Police officers had to be on guard between the two locker rooms to ensure no further confrontation. Otto Porter is quoted as calling the Celtics as dirty. Isaiah Thomas replied \"If playing hard is dirty, then I guess we are a dirty team.\"\n","In their next game in January, the Wizards wore all black to enter the game. The notion was that it is similar to the attire of a funeral. Their decision worked as they defeated the Celtics 123\u2013108. The two teams would go on to meet in the Conference Semifinals in the 2017 Playoffs. In Game 1, Markieff Morris landed on Horford's ankle after shooting a jumpshot. Morris sprained his ankle and had to miss the rest of the game which was a 123\u2013111 loss. Morris believed that Horford did this intentionally. In Game 2, Morris retaliated by grabbing Horford by the waist and pushed him into the seats. In Game 3, Kelly Olynyk set a hard screen on Kelly Oubre. Olynyk's shoulder hit Oubre in the chin causing him to drop to the floor. Oubre angrily rose and pushed Olynyk down onto the floor. Oubre was then assessed a flagrant 2 foul and was ejected while also being suspended for Game 4. No significant altercations erupted in the rest of the seven game series in which the Celtics would go on to win. The rivalry has since dissipated as the Celtics have retooled their roster but their match-ups are still seen as significant as they played on Christmas in 2017.\n","Section::::Season-by-season record.\n","\"List of the last five seasons completed by the Celtics.

It was originally designed by Zang Auerbach, the brother of Celtics head coach Red Auerbach. Through the 1995\u201396 season, the logo's only colors were black, white and green. Then for the 1996\u201397 season, celebrating the club's 50th anniversary, the logo got a full-color treatment. Lucky's face and hands were both painted tan, while gold was included on the vest, bow tie and hat, as well as brown on the ball and shillelagh, and black on its pants and shoes.\n","The Celtics also have various alternative logos, with the most popular being a white shamrock with the letters \"Celtics\" above it, wrapped in a green circle, which has been used since the 1998\u201399 season. The alternate logo is based on logos used by the Celtics before they used the Zang Auerbach leprechaun. For much of its history, the shamrock was trimmed in gold, as seen in the old team warmup jackets. A new secondary logo, unveiled in 2014, featured a variation of the leprechaun logo, in silhouette form.\n","Section::::Logos and uniforms.:Uniforms.\n","Section::::Logos and uniforms.:Uniforms.:\"Icon\" and \"Association\" uniforms.\n","For much of their history, the Celtics wore green uniforms on the road and white uniforms at home. The basic template of the current Celtics' uniforms were formalized in the 1950s, and along the way they made a few adjustments in the lettering and stripes.\n","Among the more notable changes in the uniforms were the switch from serifed to sans-serif block lettering in 1968, the addition of names in 1972, and the incorporation of the three-leaf shamrock logo in 1998. While the white uniforms remained largely intact, the green uniforms have featured either the city name (1950s\u20131965; 2014\u2013present) or the team name (1965\u20132014).\n","When Nike became the NBA's uniform provider in 2017, they decided to eliminate the \"home\" and \"away\" uniform designations. Thus the white Celtics uniforms became known as the \"Association\" uniforms while the green uniforms became the \"Icon\" uniforms. Both sets are now used regardless of home and road games.\n","In January 2017, the Celtics signed a multi-year deal with General Electric where they became the \"exclusive Data and Analytics partner\" for the team. As part of the deal, GE agreed to pay the Celtics more than $7 million per year to have the uniforms with a GE logo prominently placed on the left shoulder of jerseys in green and white. This was the first time a corporate logo were placed on the game uniforms. Along with the GE logo, the Nike logo now emblazons the right shoulder of the Celtics' uniforms.\n","Section::::Logos and uniforms.:Uniforms.:Alternate uniforms.\n","From 2005 to 2017, the Celtics wore alternate green uniforms with black lettering and trim featuring the word \"Boston\" on the front side. One noticeable difference in the alternate uniforms were the black panels with a green shamrock, reminiscent of the original Celtics uniforms worn in the late 1940s.\n","A gray uniform set was also used from 2014 to 2017. Dubbed \"Parquet Pride\", the uniforms featured sleeves (a prominent figure in Adidas' NBA uniforms), white letters with green trim, the silhouetted leprechaun logo on the shorts, the shamrock logo on the left leg, and a parquet-like pattern on the sides.\n","For 2017 and beyond, the Celtics will wear black \"Statement\" uniforms (labeled by Nike in reference to the league's third jerseys).

The initial uniforms were worn from 2006 to 2013 and it strongly resembled their regular green uniforms save for gold and white trim and the city name in front. For 2014 and 2015, the uniforms were sleeved, replaced the city name in front in favor of the team name, and now resembled their green\/black alternates. In 2016 and 2017, the uniforms were again sleeveless and featured the city name in front, but kept the previous striping.\n","During the NBA Europe Live Tour prior to the 2007\u201308 season, the Celtics used the alternate road jerseys in their game against the Toronto Raptors in Rome, except that the words \"Boston\" on the front side of the jersey and the shamrock on the shorts and on the reverse side of the jersey contained the green, white and red tricolors of the Italian flag. In the second game in London, the regular road jerseys featured a patch containing the Union Jack.\n","At the 2008\u201309 season opener against the Cleveland Cavaliers, the Celtics wore a modified version of their home uniforms, accented with gold, to commemorate last season's championship team.\n","The Celtics have also worn special edition Christmas Day uniforms since the 2008\u201309 season.

It also has Red Auerbach's signature near the uniform tag and a gold-trimmed alternate Celtics logo on the beltline. In addition, the Celtics wore an \"Earned\" edition uniform exclusive only to the 16 teams that made the 2018 NBA Playoffs.

According to legend, Celtics patriarch Red Auerbach had a problem with the white sneakers, claiming that the white sneakers can easily get dirty; hence starting a long tradition with the black sneakers. But prior to the 2003\u201304 season, current Celtics general manager Danny Ainge and captain Paul Pierce suggested wearing white sneakers, in due part to a growing number of teams wearing black sneakers. Auerbach gladly accepted and the white sneakers have remained since on home games. They still wore the black sneakers on away games, but in the 2008\u201309 season, they wore white sneakers with green and gold accents while wearing their St. Patrick's Day jerseys on the road. Most recently, when the Celtics play on Christmas Day, they wore white or green sneakers with red and gold accents. Since the 2009\u201310 season, the NBA relaxed its rules on specified sneaker colors, and Celtics players are now seen wearing custom-made and personalized sneakers at home and on the road, although for the most part they wear either green, white or black sneakers.\n","The Celtics were the only team to wear warmup jackets with the player names on the back. During the 1980s, this style was dominant in most NBA warmup jackets, but by the late 1990s, this style gradually declined.
