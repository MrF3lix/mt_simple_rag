{"kilt_id":76383,"wikipedia_id":76383,"wikipedia_title":"The Ten Commandments (1956 film)","paragraph":"The Ten Commandments is a 1956 American epic religious drama film produced, directed, and narrated by Cecil B. DeMille, shot in VistaVision (color by Technicolor), and released by Paramount Pictures. The film is based on \"Prince of Egypt\" by Dorothy Clarke Wilson, \"Pillar of Fire\" by J.H. Ingraham, \"On Eagle's Wings\" by A.E. Southon, and the Book of Exodus. \"The Ten Commandments\" dramatizes the biblical story of the life of Moses, an adopted Egyptian prince who becomes the deliverer of his real brethren, the enslaved Hebrews, and therefore leads the Exodus to Mount Sinai, where he receives, from God, the Ten Commandments. The film stars Charlton Heston in the lead role, Yul Brynner as Rameses, Anne Baxter as Nefretiri, Edward G. Robinson as Dathan, Yvonne De Carlo as Sephora, Debra Paget as Lilia, and John Derek as Joshua; and features Sir Cedric Hardwicke as Sethi, Nina Foch as Bithiah, Martha Scott as Yochabel, Judith Anderson as Memnet, and Vincent Price as Baka, among others.\n","paragraph_id":1}

This effect took about six months of VistaVision filming, and combined scenes shot on the shores of the Red Sea in Egypt, with scenes filmed at Paramount Studios in Hollywood of a huge water tank split by a U-shaped trough, into which approximately 360,000 gallons of water were released from the sides, as well as the filming of a giant waterfall also built on the Paramount backlot to create the effect of the walls of the parted sea out of the turbulent backwash. All of the multiple elements of the shot were then combined in Paul Lerpae's optical printer, and matte paintings of rocks by Jan Domela concealed the matte lines between the real elements and the special effects elements. Unlike the technique used by ILM for \"Raiders of the Lost Ark\" and \"\"Poltergeist\"\" of injecting poster paints into a glass tank containing a salt water inversion layer, the cloud effects for \"The Ten Commandments\" were formed with white Britt smoke filmed against a translucent sky backing, and colors were added optically. Striking portraits of Charlton Heston as Moses and three women in front of menacing clouds were photographed by Wallace Kelly, A.S.C. in Farciot Edouart\u2019s process (rear projection) department, in what are still considered unforgettable scenes. DeMille used these scenes to break up the montage, framing his subjects like a Renaissance master. An abundance of blue screen spillage or \"bleeding\" can be seen, particularly at the top of the superimposed walls of water, but rather than detracting from the shot, this (unintentionally) gives the scene an eerie yet spectacular appearance. The parting of the Red Sea sequence is considered by many to be one of the greatest special effects of all time.\n","paragraph_id":79}

It was contested by the French, Dutch, and British, but remained a Spanish possession for the next four centuries. The island's cultural and demographic landscapes were shaped by the displacement and assimilation of the native population, the forced migration of African slaves, and settlement from the Canary Islands and Andalusia. In the Spanish Empire, Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategic role compared to wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain. Spain's distant administrative control continued up to the end of the 19th century, producing a distinctive creole Hispanic culture and language that combined indigenous, African, and European elements. On September 23, 1868, Ram\u00f3n Emeterio Betances unleashed a revolt against Spanish rule, declaring for the first time the idea of Puerto Rico as a distinct people, with right to sovereignty. This revolt, known as El Grito de Lares, was eventually put down by Spanish forces, but the movement continued. In 1898, following the Spanish\u2013American War, the United States acquired Puerto Rico under the terms of the Treaty of Paris.

With no significant industries or large-scale agricultural production as yet, enslaved and free communities lodged around the few littoral settlements, particularly around San Juan, also forming lasting Afro-creole communities. Meanwhile, in the island's interior, there developed a mixed and independent peasantry that relied on a subsistence economy. This mostly unsupervised population supplied villages and settlements with foodstuffs and, in relative isolation, set the pattern for what later would be known as the Puerto Rican J\u00edbaro culture. By the end of the 16th century, the Spanish Empire was diminishing and, in the face of increasing raids from European competitors, the colonial administration throughout the Americas fell into a \"bunker mentality\". Imperial strategists and urban planners redesigned port settlements into military posts with the objective of protecting Spanish territorial claims and ensuring the safe passing of the king's silver-laden Atlantic Fleet to the Iberian Peninsula. San Juan served as an important port-of-call for ships driven across the Atlantic by its powerful trade winds. West Indies convoys linked Spain to the island, sailing between C\u00e1diz and the Spanish West Indies. The colony's seat of government was on the forested Islet of San Juan and for a time became one of the most heavily fortified settlements in the Spanish Caribbean earning the name of the \"Walled City\".

He then occupied the port and attacked the city while the population hurried for shelter behind the Morro's moat and high battlements. Historians consider this event the worst attack on San Juan. Though the Dutch set the village on fire, they failed to conquer the Morro, and its batteries pounded their troops and ships until Hendricksz deemed the cause lost. Hendricksz's expedition eventually helped propel a fortification frenzy. Constructions of defenses for the San Crist\u00f3bal Hill were soon ordered so as to prevent the landing of invaders out of reach of the Morro's artillery.

With the advent of the lively Bourbon Dynasty in Spain in the 1700s, the island of Puerto Rico began a gradual shift to more imperial attention. More roads began connecting previously isolated inland settlements to coastal cities, and coastal settlements like Arecibo, Mayaguez, and Ponce began acquiring importance of their own, separate from San Juan. By the end of the 18th century, merchant ships from an array of nationalities threatened the tight regulations of the Mercantilist system, which turned each colony solely toward the European metropole and limited contact with other nations. U.S. ships came to surpass Spanish trade and with this also came the exploitation of the island's natural resources. Slavers, which had made but few stops on the island before, began selling more enslaved Africans to growing sugar and coffee plantations. The increasing number of Atlantic wars in which the Caribbean islands played major roles, like the War of Jenkins' Ear, the Seven Years' War and the Atlantic Revolutions, ensured Puerto Rico's growing esteem in Madrid's eyes. On April 17, 1797, Sir Ralph Abercromby's fleet invaded the island with a force of 6,000\u201313,000 men, which included German soldiers and Royal Marines and 60 to 64 ships. Fierce fighting continued for the next days with Spanish troops. Both sides suffered heavy losses. On Sunday April 30 the British ceased their attack and began their retreat from San Juan. By the time independence movements in the larger Spanish colonies gained success, new waves of loyal creole immigrants began to arrive in Puerto Rico, helping to tilt the island's political balance toward the Crown.\n","paragraph_id":27}

When such a line is formed, it disappears and any blocks above it fall down to fill the space. When a certain number of lines are cleared, the game enters a new level.

Easy spin refers to the property of a Tetrimino to stop falling for a moment after left or right movement or rotation, effectively allowing someone to suspend the Tetrimino while thinking on where to place it. This feature has been implemented into The Tetris Company's official guideline. This type of play differs from traditional \"Tetris\" because it takes away the pressure of higher level speed. Some reviewers went so far as to say that this mechanism broke the game. The goal in \"Tetris Worlds\", however, is to complete a certain number of lines as fast as possible, so the ability to hold off a piece's placement will not make achieving that goal any faster. Later, GameSpot received \"easy spin\" more openly, saying that \"the infinite spin issue honestly really affects only a few of the single-player gameplay modes in \"Tetris DS\", because any competitive mode requires you to lay down pieces as quickly as humanly possible.\" In response to the issue, Henk Rogers stated in an interview that infinite spin was an intentional part of the game design, allowing novice players to expend some of their available scoring time to decide on the best placement of a piece. Rogers observed that \"gratuitous spinning\" does not occur in competitive play, as expert players do not require much time to think about where a piece should be placed. A limitation has been placed on infinite lock delay in later games of the franchise, where after a certain amount of inputs i.e: rotations and movements, the piece will instantly lock itself. This is defaulted to 15 inputs.\n","paragraph_id":14}

He initially considered creating a game around pentominoes, which featured in puzzle games that he had enjoyed as a child, but felt that it might have been too complicated with twelve different shape variations, so the concept switched to tetrominoes, of which there are seven variants. The Electronika 60 on which he was working had only a text-based display, so the tetrominoes were formed of letter characters.

{"kilt_id":30339,"wikipedia_id":30339,"wikipedia_title":"Tetris","paragraph":"\"Tetris\" has been subject to many changes throughout releases since the 1980s. Newer \"Tetris\" games have focused on a trend of pace rather than endurance. Older releases such as Game Boy or NES \"Tetris\" offer records according to points. Since the meter for points is restricted to a specific number of digits, these games' records can be \"maxed out\" by an experienced player. The next big Game Boy release after \"Tetris\", \"Tetris DX\", in marathon mode\u2014comparable to mode A in previous releases\u2014allowed an additional digit for the point meter. Even so, players still maxed it to 9,999,999\u00a0points after hours of play. For \"The New Tetris\", world record competitors have spent over 12\u00a0hours playing the same game. In \"Tetris DX\" and \"The New Tetris\", the new modes sprint and ultra were added. These modes require the player to act under a timer, either to gain the most lines or points in that time. Releases like \"Tetris Worlds\" removed point records. This particular game kept records by how fast a certain number of lines could be cleared depending on the level. Critics of \"Tetris Worlds\" said it was flawed by virtue of the ability of a piece to hover over the bottom for as long as a player needs.\n","paragraph_id":42}
{"kilt_id":30339,"wikipedia_id":30339,"wikipedia_title":"Tetris","paragraph":"There are many different modes of play added in recent years. Modes appearing in more than one major release include classic marathon (game A), sprint (otherwise game B or 40 lines), ultra, square, and cascade.\n","paragraph_id":43}
{"kilt_id":30339,"wikipedia_id":30339,"wikipedia_title":"Tetris","paragraph":"The field dimension of \"Tetris\" is perhaps the least deviated among releases: almost always 10 cells wide by 20 high. Some releases on handheld platforms with small screens have smaller fields; for example, the \"Tetris Jr.\" keychain game has 8 by 12, and \"Tetris\" for Game Boy has 10 by 18.\n","paragraph_id":44}
{"kilt_id":30339,"wikipedia_id":30339,"wikipedia_title":"Tetris","paragraph":"Traditionally, blocks spawn within the four most central columns and the two highest rows. The \"I\" Tetrimino occupies columns 4, 5, 6 and 7, the \"O\" Tetrimino occupies columns 5 and 6, and the remaining 5 Tetriminos occupy columns 4, 5 and 6 (or in some, especially older, versions, 5, 6 and 7). In some more recent games, pieces spawn above the visible playfield.\n","paragraph_id":45}
{"kilt_id":30339,"wikipedia_id":30339,"wikipedia_title":"Tetris","paragraph":"In traditional games, a level-up would occur once every ten lines are cleared. In some newer games such as \"Tetris Worlds\", the number of lines required varies upon each new level. After a level-up, points awarded are increased and the blocks fall slightly faster. For example, NES \"Tetris\" operates at 60 frames per second. At level 0, a piece falls one step every 48 frames, and at level 19, a piece falls one step every 2 frames. Level increments either terminate at a certain point (Game Boy \"Tetris\" tops off at level 20) or increase forever yet not in speed after a certain point. NES \"Tetris\" will level up in speed until level 29 (due to limitations of the game's engine, pieces are not capable of dropping faster than this), but tool-assisted emulation will show that the level indicator increases indefinitely\u2014eventually leading to a glitch where the meter displays non-numeric characters. Modern games such as \"Tetris the Grand Master\" or \"Tetris Worlds\", at their highest levels, opt to drop a piece more than one row per frame. Pieces will appear to reach the bottom as soon as they spawn. As a result, these games have a delay that lets the player slide the piece on the bottom for a moment to help deal with an otherwise unplayable fall speed. In some games, the hover time is regenerated after a piece is moved or rotated.\n","paragraph_id":46}
{"kilt_id":30339,"wikipedia_id":30339,"wikipedia_title":"Tetris","paragraph":"Soft drops were first implemented in Nintendo releases of \"Tetris\" so that pieces would be able to drop faster while not locking as to slide into gaps. The other option is hard dropping, which originated in early PC games such as \"Microsoft Tetris\", a game developed by Dave Edson and bundled with Microsoft Entertainment Pack. With hard dropping, a piece falls and locks in one frame. Newer \"Tetris\" games feature both options. Some games have their locking roles reversed, with soft dropping making the pieces drop faster and locking down, and hard dropping making the pieces drop instantly but not lock.\n","paragraph_id":47}
{"kilt_id":30339,"wikipedia_id":30339,"wikipedia_title":"Tetris","paragraph":"Single direction rotation is an older restriction that has since been ruled out in nearly every new official release by the favor of separate buttons for clockwise and one for counter clockwise rotation. In traditional games, the unsymmetrical vertical orientation I-, Z-, and S-pieces will fill the same columns for each clockwise and counter clockwise rotation. Some games vary this by allowing two possible column orientations: one for counter clockwise and one for clockwise rotations. Double rotation\u2014only seen in progressive clones such as \"Quadra\" and \"DTET\"\u2014rotates the piece 180\u00b0.\n","paragraph_id":48}
{"kilt_id":30339,"wikipedia_id":30339,"wikipedia_title":"Tetris","paragraph":"One of the features most appreciated by skilled players is \"wall kick\" or the ability to rotate the pieces even if these touch the left or right walls. In the NES version, for example, if a Z piece is \"vertically\" aligned and falling touching the left wall, the player cannot rotate the piece, giving the impression that the rotate buttons are locked. In this situation, the player has to move the piece one position to the right before rotating it, losing precious time. Proper implementations of wall kick first appeared in the arcade version of \"Tetris\" by Atari Games.\n","paragraph_id":49}

{"kilt_id":30339,"wikipedia_id":30339,"wikipedia_title":"Tetris","paragraph":"The question \"Would it be possible to play forever?\" was first encountered in a thesis by John Brzustowski in 1992. The conclusion reached was that the game is statistically doomed to end. The reason has to do with the S and Z Tetriminos. If a player receives a sufficiently large sequence of alternating S and Z Tetriminos, the na\u00efve gravity used by the standard game eventually forces the player to leave holes on the board. The holes will necessarily stack to the top and, ultimately, end the game. If the pieces are distributed randomly, this sequence will eventually occur. Thus, if a game with, for example, an ideal, uniform, uncorrelated random number generator is played long enough, any player will top out.\n","paragraph_id":59}
{"kilt_id":30339,"wikipedia_id":30339,"wikipedia_title":"Tetris","paragraph":"In practice, this does not occur in most \"Tetris\" variants. Some variants allow the player to choose to play with only S and Z Tetriminos, and a good player may survive well over 150 consecutive Tetriminos this way. On an implementation with an ideal uniform randomizer, the probability at any given time of the next 150 Tetriminos being only S and Z is () (approximately ). Most implementations use a pseudorandom number generator to generate the sequence of Tetriminos, and such an S\u2013Z sequence is almost certainly not contained in the sequence produced by the 32-bit linear congruential generator in many implementations (which has roughly states). The \"evil\" algorithm in \"Bastet\" (an unofficial variant) often starts a game with a series of more than seven Z pieces.\n","paragraph_id":60}

The two had completed writing and producing their 2015 film \"Hidden\", which they had tried to emulate the style of M. Night Shyamalan. However, due to changes at Warner Bros., its distributor, the film did not see a wide release and the Duffer Brothers were unsure of their future. To their surprise, television producer Donald De Line approached them, impressed with \"Hidden\"s script, and offered them the opportunity to work on episodes of \"Wayward Pines\" alongside Shyamalan. The brothers were mentored by Shyamalan during the episode's production, so that when they finished, they felt they were ready to produce their own television series.\n","paragraph_id":31}
{"kilt_id":46301800,"wikipedia_id":46301800,"wikipedia_title":"Stranger Things","paragraph":"The Duffer Brothers prepared a script that would essentially be similar to the series' actual pilot episode, along with a 20-page pitch book to help shop the series around for a network. They pitched the story to about fifteen cable networks, all of which rejected the script on the basis that they felt a plot centered around children as leading characters would not work, asking them to make it a children's series or to drop the children and focus on Hopper's investigation in the paranormal. In early 2015, Dan Cohen, the VP of 21 Laps Entertainment, brought the script to his colleague Shawn Levy. They subsequently invited the Duffer Brothers to their office and purchased the rights for the series, giving full authorship of it to the brothers. After reading the pilot, the streaming service Netflix purchased the whole season for an undisclosed amount; the series was subsequently announced for a planned 2016 release by Netflix in early April 2015. The Duffer Brothers stated that at the time they had pitched to Netflix, the service had already gotten recognized for its original programming, such as \"House of Cards\" and \"Orange Is the New Black\", with well-recognized producers behind them, and were ready to start giving upcoming producers like them a chance. The brothers started to write out the series and brought Levy and Cohen in as executive producers to start casting and filming.\n","paragraph_id":32}
{"kilt_id":46301800,"wikipedia_id":46301800,"wikipedia_title":"Stranger Things","paragraph":"The series was originally known as \"Montauk\". The setting was then Montauk, New York and nearby Long Island locations. Montauk figured into a number of real world conspiracy theories involving secret government experiments. The brothers had chosen Montauk as it had further Spielberg ties with the film \"Jaws\", where Montauk was used for the fictional setting of Amity Island. After deciding to change the narrative of the series to take place in the fictional town of Hawkins instead, the brothers felt they could now do things to the town, such as placing it under quarantine, that they really could not envision with a real location. With the change in location, they had to come up with a new title for the series under direction from Netflix's Ted Sarandos so that they could start marketing it to the public. The brothers started by using a copy of Stephen King's \"Firestarter\" novel to consider the title's font and appearance, and came up with a long list of potential alternatives. \"Stranger Things\" came about as it sounded similar to another King novel, \"Needful Things\", though Matt noted they still had a \"lot of heated arguments\" over this final title.\n","paragraph_id":33}

{"kilt_id":46301800,"wikipedia_id":46301800,"wikipedia_title":"Stranger Things","paragraph":"The idea of \"Stranger Things\" started with how the brothers felt they could take the concept of the 2013 film \"Prisoners\", detailing the moral struggles a father goes through when his daughter is kidnapped, and expand it out over eight or so hours in a serialized television approach. As they focused on the missing child aspect of the story, they wanted to introduce the idea of \"childlike sensibilities\" they could offer, and toyed around with the idea of a monster that could consume humans. The brothers thought the combination of these things \"was the best thing ever\". To introduce this monster into the narrative, they considered \"bizarre experiments we had read about taking place in the Cold War\" such as Project MKUltra, which gave a way to ground the monster's existence in science rather than something spiritual. This also helped them to decide on using 1983 as the time period, as it was a year before the film \"Red Dawn\" came out, which focused on Cold War paranoia. Subsequently, they were able to use all their own personal inspirations from the 1980s, the decade they were born, as elements of the series, crafting it in the realm of science fiction and horror. Other influences cited by the Duffer Brothers include: Stephen King novels; films produced by Steven Spielberg, John Carpenter, Wes Craven, and Guillermo del Toro; films such as \"Star Wars\", \"Alien\", and \"Stand by Me\"; Japanese anime such as \"Akira\" and \"Elfen Lied\"; and several video games including \"Silent Hill\", \"Dark Souls\" and \"The Last of Us\". The Duffer Brothers also believe that they may have brought influences from other works unintentionally, including \"Beyond the Black Rainbow\" and \"D.A.R.Y.L.\", discovered by reviewing fan feedback on the series. Several websites and publications have found other pop culture references in the series, particularly references to 1980s pop culture.\n","paragraph_id":36}
{"kilt_id":46301800,"wikipedia_id":46301800,"wikipedia_title":"Stranger Things","paragraph":"With Netflix as the platform, the Duffer Brothers were not limited to a typical 22-episode format, opting for the eight-episode approach. They had been concerned that a 22-episode season on broadcast television would be difficult to \"tell a cinematic story\" with that many episodes. Eight episodes allowed them to give time to characterization in addition to narrative development; if they had less time available, they would have had to remain committed to telling a horror film as soon as the monster was introduced and abandon the characterization. Within the eight episodes, the brothers aimed to make the first season \"feel like a big movie\" with all the major plot lines completed so that \"the audience feels satisfied\", but left enough unresolved to indicate \"there's a bigger mythology, and there's a lot of dangling threads at the end\", something that could be explored in further seasons if Netflix opted to create more.\n","paragraph_id":37}

The brothers' casting director Carmen Cuba had suggested Ryder for the role of Joyce, which the two were immediately drawn to because of her predominance in the films of the 1980s. Levy believed Ryder could \"wretch up the emotional urgency and yet find layers and nuance and different sides of [Joyce]\". Ryder praised that the show's multiple storylines required her to act for Joyce as \"she's out of her mind, but she's actually kind of onto something\", and that the producers had faith she could pull off the difficult role. The Duffer Brothers had been interested in Harbour before, who until \"Stranger Things\" primarily had smaller roles as villainous characters, and they felt that he had been \"waiting too long for this opportunity\" to play a lead, while Harbour himself was thrilled by the script and the chance to play \"a broken, flawed, anti-hero character\".\n","paragraph_id":40}

In September 2015, Cara Buono joined the cast as Karen, followed by Matthew Modine as Martin Brenner a month later.

{"kilt_id":46301800,"wikipedia_id":46301800,"wikipedia_title":"Stranger Things","paragraph":"Actors auditioning for the children roles read lines from \"Stand By Me\". The Duffer Brothers estimated they went through about a thousand different child actors for the roles. They noted that Wolfhard was already \"a movie buff\" of the films from the 1980s period and easily filled the role, while they found Matarazzo's audition to be much more authentic than most of the other audition tapes, and selected him after a single viewing of his audition tape. As casting was started immediately after Netflix greenlit the show, and prior to the scripts being fully completed, this allowed some of the actor's takes on the roles to reflect into the script. The casting of the young actors for Will and his friends had been done just after the first script was completed, and subsequent scripts incorporated aspects from these actors. The brothers said Modine provided significant input on the character of Dr. Brenner, whom they had not really fleshed out before as they considered him the hardest character to write for given his limited appearances within the narrative.\n","paragraph_id":42}

However, with filming scheduled to take place in November 2015, it was difficult to shoot in Long Island in the cold weather, and the production started scouting locations in and around the Atlanta, Georgia area. The brothers, who grew up in North Carolina, found many places that reminded them of their own childhoods in that area, and felt the area would work well with the narrative shift to the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.\n","paragraph_id":44}

Jackson served as the basis of the fictional town of Hawkins, Indiana.

{"kilt_id":46301800,"wikipedia_id":46301800,"wikipedia_title":"Stranger Things","paragraph":"To create the aged effect for the series, a film grain was added over the footage, which was captured by scanning in film stock from the 1980s. The Duffer Brothers wanted to scare the audience, but not to necessarily make the series violent or gory, following in line with how the 1980s Amblin Entertainment films drove the creation of the PG-13 movie rating. It was \"much more about mood and atmosphere and suspense and dread than they are about gore\", though they were not afraid to push into more scary elements, particularly towards the end of the first season. The brothers had wanted to avoid any computer-generated effects for the monster and other parts of the series and stay with practical effects, so they created an animatronic to play the part of the demogorgon. However, the six-month filming time left them little time to plan out and test practical effects rigs for some of the shots. They went with a middle ground of using constructed props including one for the monster whenever they could, but for other shots, such as when the monster bursts through a wall, they opted to use digital effects. Post-production on the first season was completed the week before it was released to Netflix.\n","paragraph_id":47}
{"kilt_id":46301800,"wikipedia_id":46301800,"wikipedia_title":"Stranger Things","paragraph":"The title sequence uses closeups of the letters in the \"Stranger Things\" title with a red tint against a black background as they slide into place within the title. The sequence was created by the studio Imaginary Forces, formerly part of R\/GA, led by creative director Michelle Doughtey. Levy introduced the studio to the Duffer Brothers, who explained their vision of the 1980s-inspired series, which helped the studio to fix the concept the producers wanted. Later, but prior to filming, the producers sent Imaginary Forces the pilot script, the synth-heavy background music for the titles, as well as the various book covers from King and other authors that they had used to establish the title and imagery, and were looking for a similar approach for the series' titles, primarily using a typographical sequence. They took inspiration from several title sequences of works from the 1980s that were previously designed by Richard Greenberg under R\/GA, such as \"Altered States\" and \"The Dead Zone\". They also got input from Dan Perri, who worked on the title credits of several 1980s films. Various iterations included having letters vanish, to reflect the \"missing\" theme of the series, and having letters cast shadows on others, alluding to the mysteries, before settling into the sliding letters. The studio began working on the title sequence before filming, and took about a month off during the filming process to let the producers get immersed in the series and come back with more input. Initially they had been working with various fonts for the title and used close-ups of the best features of these fonts, but near the end the producers wanted to work with ITC Benguiat, requiring them to rework those shots. The final sequence is fully computer generated, but they took inspiration from testing some practical effects, such as using Kodalith masks as would have been done in the 1980s, to develop the appropriate filters for the rendering software. The individual episode title cards used a \"fly through\" approach, similar to the film \"Bullitt\", which the producers had suggested to the studio.\n","paragraph_id":48}

The Duffer Brothers discovered the band through the 2014 film \"The Guest\", where Survive features on the soundtrack. Once the series was green-lit, the Duffer Brothers contacted Survive around July 2015 to ask if they were still doing music; the two provided the production team with dozens of songs from their band's past to gain their interest, helping to land them the role. Once aboard, the two worked with producers to select some of their older music to rework for the series, while developing new music, principally with character motifs. The two had been hired before the casting process, so their motif demos were used and played over the actors' audition tapes, aiding in the casting selection. The series' theme is based on an unused work Stein composed much earlier that ended up in the library of work they shared with the production staff, who thought that with some reworking would be good for the opening credits.\n","paragraph_id":51}

The game uses a retro-pixel style of art, similar to games for the Super Nintendo Entertainment System. The game is loosely based on the \"Stranger Things\" story after season one, with the player starting as Chief of Police Jim Hopper looking for the missing boys. Once these characters are found, they become playable and have special abilities that allow the player to access more areas in the game. BonusXP had less than a year to complete the game. The team decided to make the game in a similar style to \"The Legend of Zelda\" because it \"was a perfect match because both [\"Stranger Things\" and \"Zelda\"] are about exploration, and it's kind of a mysterious fit that fit the mood of the show,\" according to BonusXP president Dave Pottinger. The map of Hawkins in the game was based on a Google street view map of Jackson, Georgia where the series is filmed. In order to help keep the game a secret, BonusXP did not hire game testers for their quality assurance, instead having family members from the design team provide feedback; this process helped create the two difficulty levels in the game. Completing the game gives players a clip from the first episode of the second season of the series. The game was downloaded 3 million times in the first week, becoming a top download and receiving critical praise. With the release of season two, an update to the game added Max as a playable character, and a release for the Amazon Fire TV, which included controller support. The game was nominated for \"Mobile Game\" at the 14th British Academy Games Awards.\n","paragraph_id":93}

In District 12, after her younger sister Primrose is chosen, Katniss Everdeen volunteers to take her place. She and fellow tribute Peeta Mellark are escorted to the Capitol by their chaperone Effie Trinket and mentor Haymitch Abernathy, the only victor for district 12 in the nation's history.

Alli Shearmur and Jim Miller, president and senior vice president of motion picture production at Lionsgate, took charge of overseeing the production of the film, which they described as \"an incredible property... a thrill to bring home to Lionsgate\". The studio, which had not made a profit for five years, raided the budgets of other productions and sold assets to secure a budget of $88,000,000\u2014one of its largest ever\u2014for the film. Collins' agent Jason Dravis remarked that \"they [Lionsgate] had everyone but the valet call us\" to help secure the franchise.

The screenplay remains extremely faithful to the original novel, with Ross saying he \"felt the only way to make the film really successful was to be totally subjective\", echoing Collins' presentation of the novel in the first person present. Instead of Katniss' internal monologue about the Capitol's machinations, the screenplay expanded the character of Seneca Crane, the Head Gamemaker, to allow several developments to be shown directly to the audience. Ross explained, \"In the book, Katniss speculates about the game-makers' manipulations... in the film, we can't get inside Katniss's head, but we do have the ability to cut away and actually show the machinations of the Capitol behind the scenes. I created the game centre and also expanded the role of Seneca Crane for those reasons. I thought it was totally important.\" Ross also added several scenes between Crane and Coriolanus Snow, the elderly President of Panem, noting that \"I thought that it was very interesting that there would be one generation [of Panem citizens] who knew that [the Games] were actually an instrument of political control, and there would be a successive generation who was so enamoured with the ratings and the showbiz and the sensations and the spectacle that was subsuming the actual political intention, and that's really where the tension is\".\n","paragraph_id":35}

Ross commented, \"so much of the film happens in the woods that it's easy to forget this is a futuristic society, manipulating these events for the sake of an audience. The look of the control center, the antiseptic feeling of it and the use of holograms were all intended to make the arena feel 'constructed' even when you weren't seeing the control room.\" Ross and visual effects supervisor Sheena Duggal were keen to use the omniscient view that the setting provided to justify the literal dei ex machina Katniss experiences in the arena; Duggal explained that \"we really didn't want to have to explain things... how do you get compelled by these [animals] that just appear at the end of the movie? We wanted to find a way to introduce them without having to explain specifically and exactly what they were and the game room was a really great opportunity for us to be able to do that.\"\n","paragraph_id":36}

Comparisons were also made between \"The Hunger Games\" premise of children killing each other, and the child soldiers of the Lord's Resistance Army led by Joseph Kony. In a Jezebel article published March 26, 2012, Dodai Stewart reported that several users on Twitter posted racist tweets, criticizing the portrayals of Rue, Thresh and Cinna by African American actors. In a 2011 interview with \"Entertainment Weekly\", Collins stated that while she did not have any ethnic background in mind for lead characters Katniss and Gale because the book is written in \"a time period where hundreds of years have passed\" and there would be \"a lot of ethnic mixing\", she explains \"there are some characters in the book who are more specifically described\", and states that both Rue and Thresh are African American. Lyneka Little of \"The Wall Street Journal\" states that although it is easy to find bigoted or offensive postings online, \"the racist 'Hunger Games' tweets, because they are so shockingly ignorant even by the standards of the fringes of the internet, have kicked up a storm\".\n","paragraph_id":75}

Two: you definitely lack basic reading comprehension. Mazel tov!\" Erik Kain of \"Forbes\" saw the controversy as a way to appreciate the value of free speech.

One response pointed to Collins's physical description of Katniss in \"The Hunger Games\" novel which reads: \"I stand straight, and while I'm thin, I'm strong. The meat and plants from the woods combined with the exertion it took to get them have given me a healthier body than most of those I see around me.\" \"Los Angeles Times\" writer Alexandra Le Tellier commented that \"[t]he sexist commentary along with the racist barbs made by so-called fans are as stomach-churning as the film's cultural commentary, which, in part, shines a light on the court of public opinion and its sometimes destructive power to determine someone else's fate\".\n","paragraph_id":78}

Led by Russell and superstar point guard Bob Cousy, the Celtics won their first NBA championship in 1957. Russell, along with a talented supporting cast of future Hall of Famers including John Havlicek, Tom Heinsohn, K. C. Jones, Sam Jones, Satch Sanders, and Bill Sharman, would usher the Celtics into the greatest period in franchise history, winning eight consecutive NBA championships throughout the 1960s. After the retirement of Russell in 1969, the Celtics entered a period of rebuilding. Led by center Dave Cowens and point guard JoJo White, the Celtics returned to championship caliber, winning two NBA titles in 1974 and 1976. The Celtics again returned to dominance in the 1980s. Led by the \"Big Three\" that featured Larry Bird, Kevin McHale, and Robert Parish, the Celtics won the 1981, 1984, and 1986 championships. After winning 16 championships throughout the 20th century, the Celtics, after struggling through the 1990s, rose again to win a championship in 2008 with the help of Kevin Garnett, Paul Pierce, and Ray Allen in what was known as the new \"Big Three\" era.\n","paragraph_id":3}

However, with the acquisition of K.C. Jones that year, the Celtics began a dynasty that would last for more than a decade. In 1959, the Celtics won the NBA Championship after sweeping the Minneapolis Lakers, the first of their record eight consecutive championships. During that time, the Celtics met the Lakers in the Finals five times, starting an intense and often bitter rivalry that has spanned generations. In 1964, the Celtics became the first NBA team to have an all African-American starting lineup. On December 26, 1964, Willie Naulls replaced an injured Tommy Heinsohn, joining Tom 'Satch' Sanders, K.C. Jones, Sam Jones, and Bill Russell in the starting lineup. The Celtics defeated St. Louis 97\u201384. Boston won its next 11 games with Naulls starting in place of Heinsohn.

However, with the acquisition of Dave Cowens, Paul Silas, and Jo Jo White, the Celtics soon became dominant again. After losing in the Eastern Conference Finals in 1972, the Celtics regrouped and came out determined in 1973 and posted an excellent 68\u201314 regular season record. But the season ended in disappointment, as they were upset in 7 games by the New York Knicks in the Conference Finals. John Havlicek injured his right shoulder in game six and was forced to play game 7 shooting left handed. The Celtics returned to the playoffs the next year, defeating the Milwaukee Bucks in the NBA Finals in 1974 for their 12th NBA Championship. The teams split the first four games, and after the Celtics won Game 5 in Milwaukee they headed back to Boston leading three games to two, with a chance to claim the title on their home court. However, the Bucks won Game 6 when Kareem Abdul-Jabbar nestled in a hook shot with 3\u00a0seconds left in the game's second overtime, and the series returned to Milwaukee. But Cowens was the hero in Game 7, scoring 28 points, as the Celtics brought the title back to Boston for the first time in five years. In 1976, the team won yet another championship, defeating the Phoenix Suns in six games. The Finals featured one of the greatest games in the NBA's history. With the series tied at two games apiece, the Suns trailed early in the Boston Garden, but came back to force overtime. In double overtime, a Gar Heard turn-around jumper at the top of the key sent the game to a third overtime, at which point the Celtics prevailed. Tommy Heinsohn coached the team for those two championships. After the 1976 championship and a playoff appearance in 1977, Boston went into another rebuilding phase. In the 1977 NBA draft, the Celtics drafted a young forward from UNC Charlotte named Cedric Maxwell. \"Cornbread\" Maxwell did not contribute much in his rookie season, but he showed promise. Auerbach's job became even tougher following the 1977\u201378 season in which they went 32\u201350 as John Havlicek, the Celtics' all-time leading scorer, retired after 16 seasons.\n","paragraph_id":15}

The team would retain his rights for one year\u2014a rule that was later changed\u2014and Bird indeed signed soon after leading Indiana State to the NCAA Championship game.

Brown, Jr. for control of the Buffalo Braves, which he moved to California as the San Diego Clippers. As part of the deal, trades were made between the two franchises which resulted in many former Braves joining the Celtics. A move that irked Auerbach was a trade Brown made with the Braves that saw Buffalo's franchise center Bob McAdoo join the Celtics in return for three first round draft picks Auerbach had planned on using for rebuilding the Celtics. The dispute nearly led to him resigning as general manager for a similar position with the New York Knicks. With public support strongly behind Auerbach, Brown sold the team to Harry Mangurian rather than run the risk of losing his famed general manager.

He also picked up point guard Gerald Henderson from the CBA. Carr, Archibald, Henderson and Ford formed a highly competent backcourt, blending in well with the talented frontcourt of Cowens, Maxwell and Bird. With Bird winning NBA Rookie of the Year honors the team went 61\u201321, a 32-game improvement from the previous season.

Pitino's appointment as team president was controversial as Auerbach, the incumbent who had filled that role for more than 25 years, first heard about the change from local media. Unfortunately for the franchise, Pitino was not the savior everyone hoped he'd be. Auerbach bore the insult of being elbowed out with dignity, even as the team failed to improve.\n","paragraph_id":33}

Walter McCarty was also acquired in a trade with the Knicks. With a promising start, upsetting the defending champions Chicago Bulls at home on opening night, and hard play from the youngsters that led to leaderships in turnovers and steals, the team improved its victories from 15 to 36 despite many losing streaks. Billups was subsequently traded to the Raptors during his rookie year, and Mercer was traded to the Nuggets during his third season.\n","paragraph_id":34}

However, the Blackhawks could not field a truly competitive team until they moved to St. Louis as the St. Louis Hawks after a four-year stopover at Milwaukee. The two teams have faced each other eleven times in the NBA Playoffs, four times in the NBA Finals, with the Celtics winning ten of twelve series against the Hawks, including three out of four NBA Finals. While the Hawks have only defeated the Celtics twice out of eleven series in the NBA Playoffs, they still often managed to make their series with the Celtics memorable. The rivalry intensified in 2016 with Hawks All-Star Center Al Horford spurning the team and joining the Celtics.\n","paragraph_id":66}

{"kilt_id":43376,"wikipedia_id":43376,"wikipedia_title":"Boston Celtics","paragraph":"The Boston Celtics were once rivals of the New Jersey Nets during the early 2000s due to their respective locations and their burgeoning stars. The Nets were led by Jason Kidd and Kenyon Martin, while the Celtics were experiencing newfound success behind Paul Pierce and Antoine Walker. The rivalry began to heat up in the 2002 Eastern Conference Finals, which was preceded by trash talking from the Celtics who claimed Martin was a \"fake\" tough guy. Things progressed as the series started, and on-court tensions seemed to spill into the stands. Celtics' fans berated Kidd and his family with chants of \"Wife Beater!\" in response to Kidd's 2001 domestic abuse charge. When asked about the fan barbs being traded, Kenyon Martin stated, \"Our fans hate them, their fans hate us.\" Bill Walton said at the time that Nets-Celtics was the \"beginning of the next great NBA rivalry\" during the Eastern Conference Finals in 2002 with the Nets advancing to the NBA Finals, though New Jersey would go on to sweep Boston in the 2003 playoffs. In 2012, the year the Nets returned to New York in the borough of Brooklyn, there were indications that the rivalry might be rekindled when an altercation occurred on the court on November 28, resulting in the ejection of Rajon Rondo, Gerald Wallace, and Kris Humphries. Rondo was suspended for two games in the aftermath, while Wallace and Kevin Garnett were fined. The story was revisited on December 25, when Wallace grabbed Garnett's shorts and the two had to be broken up by referees and players alike. However, the rivalry between the Nets and the Celtics appeared significantly cooled off by the June 2013 blockbuster trade that dealt Celtics stars Garnett and Paul Pierce to the Nets in exchange for Wallace, Humphries, and others. This move was billed as a merger of the two Atlantic Division teams. Celtics announcer Sean Grande said \"It's almost as if you found a great home for these guys. You couldn't have found a better place. These guys will be in the New York market, they'll be on a competitive team, they'll stay on national TV. It's funny, because the enemy of my enemy is my friend. So with Celtics fans feeling the way they do about the Heat, feeling the way they do about the Knicks, the Nets are going to become almost the second [Boston] team now.\" The trade would end up crippling the Nets who posted a record of 151\u2013259 following the trade including three consecutive seasons with fewer than 30 wins from 2016 to 2018. Brooklyn would win just one playoff series with Garnett and Pierce, neither of whom were with the team by the close of the 2014\u20132015 season. The Celtics would use Brooklyn's draft picks to acquire Jaylen Brown and Jayson Tatum through the draft in 2016 and 2017 respectively and Kyrie Irving via trade, en route to consecutive appearances in the Eastern Conference Finals in 2017 and 2018.\n","paragraph_id":68}

Although both teams had engaged in a fight in 1984, the rivalry intensified during the 2015\u201316 season in a January regular season game after Jae Crowder was given a technical foul. Crowder then began to exchange words with then Wizards coach Randy Wittman. It began to escalate that off-season when the Celtics were trying to sign Al Horford. It was publicly reported that Jae Crowder emphasized that the Celtics beat the Wizards in all of their meetings that season and should sign with them rather than Washington. In their first meeting of the 2016\u201317 season, Wall hit Marcus Smart in the back-court when they were up by 20 late in the 4th quarter. Wall was hit with a Flagrant 2 foul and was promptly ejected. Smart immediately got back up and began to scuffle with Wall. Their words continued even after being separated with Wall telling Smart to meet him out back after the game. No incident was reported between the two following the game. In their next meeting, the Celtics won 117\u2013108. However, after the game Wall and Crowder exchanged words in front of the Wizards bench. Crowder ended up trying to jab his finger at Wall's nose and Wall tried to fight back with a slap. Teammates and coaches from both sides had to step in and separate the two teams but the players continued to yell while entering their respective locker rooms. Police officers had to be on guard between the two locker rooms to ensure no further confrontation. Otto Porter is quoted as calling the Celtics as dirty. Isaiah Thomas replied \"If playing hard is dirty, then I guess we are a dirty team.\"\n","paragraph_id":79}

The two teams would go on to meet in the Conference Semifinals in the 2017 Playoffs. In Game 1, Markieff Morris landed on Horford's ankle after shooting a jumpshot. Morris sprained his ankle and had to miss the rest of the game which was a 123\u2013111 loss. Morris believed that Horford did this intentionally. In Game 2, Morris retaliated by grabbing Horford by the waist and pushed him into the seats. In Game 3, Kelly Olynyk set a hard screen on Kelly Oubre. Olynyk's shoulder hit Oubre in the chin causing him to drop to the floor. Oubre angrily rose and pushed Olynyk down onto the floor. Oubre was then assessed a flagrant 2 foul and was ejected while also being suspended for Game 4. No significant altercations erupted in the rest of the seven game series in which the Celtics would go on to win. The rivalry has since dissipated as the Celtics have retooled their roster but their match-ups are still seen as significant as they played on Christmas in 2017.\n","paragraph_id":80}
